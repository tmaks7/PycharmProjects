api.OpenSubtitles.org is deprecated, please implement REST API from OpenSubtitles.com Sir, please try our roasted chicken. Mee, it's really value for money. Where are you going? —We are going to Shenzhen. —There are fools waiting for us. Go to Shenzhen to look for fools... Oh my gosh! Why am I that lucky? I don't want people thinking I'm a swindler! Well, just four of ten. I'll let you beat me! You don't want to? Are you sure? You are giving me a hard time! I am going to deal another three twos. Do you have another three twos? A small straight. Each of you pay four times the normal loss. What? You have a problem with that? My name is Lo. Look for me if you need help. Lo? I haven't heard of you. It doesn't matter! Anyway, I am the winner. If you don't feel good, challenge me. That's why I always say... A small bet can make you rich. A big bet can save the world. Fatty, don't be so cocky! So what? I can afford to be cocky! My uncle is a military officer. Do you want to be shot dead? It will cost you seven dollars a bullet for your life? Shut your mouth. He is a somebody. Apologize now. Okay. Let's stop for a while after this game. You better go take a leak or you'll end up with kidney trouble. I have so much money that I don't know how to spend it. I'm going to have a good time with a chick, get it? I take it you that you surrender this game. Each of you only need to pay double. —So little? —Deal now and shut your mouth. Three queens. Three kings. Three aces. And three twos. Can you beat me? And a three. All of you lose four times the bet. I am sorry.. I want to make a call to my chick. This scumbag is really cocky! Who is he? Is he your friend? —I don't know him well. —You don't? I need to go to the toilet. When he comes back, let's raise the bet. —Two thousand for each card. —Okay I want... I want you... I want your money... Give it all to me. —Finished? —Oh, don't hurt me! You were so cocky. You wanted to beat me? Don't hurt me! You humiliated me like that! —How dare you... —Don't! How dare you... How cocky! Hey! No, I didn't make a call. Do you want to play the game again? Well, I just squeezed a pimple. Let's go. Where has Fatty gone to? —Are you going to play this game? —Sure! If he joins the game, will you... No problem... —No problem? Okay, deal now. —No problem. That fat scumbag won and left. He was so cocky! I am a crazy man! Don't get agitated... Seven! I lost so much, if I can't deal this seven... I'll blow my head off at once. Do you think I can make it? This seven passed. Two of hearts. What? You can beat me. You won't die, but I'll kill myself. Go ahead. Don't you have the biggest two? How can that be? What rotten luck! You passed? So, this is a small straight, three, four, five, six, seven. What? Can't you beat it? Can't you deal anything? No? No one can beat this small straight? So, how about this flush? Last card. I won! All of you lose four times the bet. Pay up. Again! Deal. I am lucky tonight. I won about $800,000. Let's play another game some other day. All right, since I didn't lose. Let's go. Let's go. What's wrong with you? Why did you keep giving him a chance to deal? That scumbag has a gun. He killed Lo in the toilet. I was worried that he would kill us. Are you kidding? It's true, you can take a look... Granny, where is the man who was shot? No one was shot! A scumbag poured some ketchup on the ground. Ketchup? Darn! He tricked us. Uncle Lo. How much did we win tonight? Around a million! Am I right? Fools in Shenzhen are easier targets than those in Hong Kong. Sure! Usually, rascals make big bets. The economic situation in Macau and Hong Kong isn't good.. so they must have come to Shenzhen. Look, there are even more chicks here. You can do anything to them. Right? It's a paradise! You can find many triad kingpins here. We won so much money recently, we'd better stop. Otherwise, we'll be courting trouble. It sounds reasonable. Cut the crap. Let's have fun with the chicks. Don't go too far. He got tons of chicks here. He may be fat but he has a sharp tongue. He turns chicks on with his honey lips. You should learn from him. I really want to learn it. Brother Who-the-hell, why is your name so funny? When my mother gave birth to me, my father wasn't around. She was furious. When the nurse asked her for my name... she said "Who the hell." Perhaps the nurse wanted to fool her so she filled in Who-the-hell. So, you're named Who-the-hell. I prefer having no name. Is Lo your mother's brother? Yes, when I was a child, my mom took me to Guangzhou. I met my uncle some years ago. How did you become such a great swindler? I met my master in Guangzhou. But it was hard to make a living in Mainland China. So I tried my luck in Hong Kong. So your uncle took you to Hong Kong. Let me tell you, my surname is Shaw. What's your name? Shaw. Are you Run-run Shaw? But he is thin. He is my father, but we have no blood relationship. Are you kidding me? Are you scared? He just wants to chat with me. Why do you waste time in such a place? I've noticed you for a long time. My real identity is an investigator of the National Morale Council. Be a good girl and go home now. If I see you here again, I'll put you behind bars at once. I think you are her father. —Go take her home. —Father? What's the matter? Police raid? Go to hell... Brother Lo is being beaten. Stop it. Let's talk. What's the matter? Let's talk. He wants to court my woman. Do you think he should be beaten? I am sorry! We are from Hong Kong. We know nothing. He wants to court Mr Tough's woman! Just saying sorry is not enough. Who do you think you are? He is my uncle. His name is Lo My name is Lo Who-the-hell. I have heard of you guys. You've made a lot of money in Shenzhen. Yes, can you give us some face? All right, he held my woman's waist. So leave his hand behind. Isn't that a bit too much? I am a powerful man. I can do what I want. Okay, can I have a bet with you? Double or nothing. If I win, you should leave your hand right here too. How do you want to play? Each of us take one card. The one with the bigger card wins. Do you think you're the boss? Guess. Two of hearts. Well done! —Can we go now? —Not that easy! One more game. I'll cut the card myself. You must keep your promise. Did I say I only want to play one game? If I win this game again, what will you do? If you lose, I want Fatty's hand. If you win, I'll give you $100,000. Be careful! All right. How about this one? Two of hearts again! You're something indeed. How did you know? You can turn all the cards up. Smart guy! Because of your skills, I'll let your uncle go. Should I say thank you? Kid, no one dares to offend me in Shenzhen. In Hong Kong, no one can force me to gamble with them. Uncle, let's go. —You are back. —Yes. —You look tired. —I am a little tired. Are you hurt? I gave them a good trashing. It's not surprising that I hurt myself too. —That's right. —Why were you in a fight? —That guy was bleeding profusely. —Are you hurt? A little bit... Let me treat your wound with a hard-boiled egg. I prefer if you cook the egg for me. I've made some sweet soup for you. —I'll make it lighter. —All right. What are you laughing at? We envy Uncle. He's so lucky! He is fat. But he has a woman who loves him very much. What did you say? It's Mee... No, I should greet you auntie. Cut the crap. Go and look for chicks. Early bird catches the worm. Get going. Let's go. I bet Uncle wants to have a good time. You're so mean! Did you win today? Of course. Frankly, I don't like you going to Shenzhen. You always end up in a fight. Even if I stay home I'll get hurt by an earthquake. I'm worried about your safety. I am home now. —Let's go in. —No! Lunar New Year is coming. We can make love even if the Lunar New Year is coming. I hate Lunar New Year. Folks always ask me when I'm getting married. Anyway, isn't it better to receive red-packet than to give out? When I decided to be with you, you were 120 lbs. Now, you are almost 200 lbs. Isn't that great? You have gained one and a half man. I am serious. I know, but we still have to make love right? I don't want to... that's all you think of. I must admit one thing. Sex is something important in love. It also means that you are important to me. You smooth talker! Safe investment. My master taught me I must save the money that I earned. I can't be a swindler my whole life. Otherwise, my life is gone. But your master is fine. He's got only one eye one hand and his legs are broken. He wears a urine bag all the time. And he's only got one testicle. Boss, are you staring at a girl? Yes. Is it the one with long hair? That's right. Do you know she's blind? How can a blind person be a model? She is the only blind model in Hong Kong. I can't believe it. You can see her interviews in many magazines and TV shows. Boss, are we going to the bank or do you want to continue staring at her? Let's go, you stupid Fatty! Let me tell you. Twenty per cent discount on best over one point five goals. No discount for under. But Man United will definitely win. I think Man United will score at least five goals. Beckham is in fantastic form these days. Keane and Yorke are just as good too. —Which team do you want to bet on? —Man United of course. —How much is your bet? —Five thousand. Deal. It's easy to make money in football bets. Everyone bets on Man United. The football players are human beings too. They did well last year. This year they may not do the same. But everyone believes in legend. Otherwise, how can we make big money? Let's take Chicken as an example. He seems to be our slave. He gives me money every Saturday. Did he pay the old debt? Yes, he seems to be rich. He bets $20,000 on Man United. Darn! How can he miss it? Man United lost one goal. I'm rich! You've made so much money already. I think you should marry Mee. You can't spoil a woman. As long as I am not married, I am still an available bachelor. Maybe Madonna will fall for me. You're heartless! How many years have you known her? Ten? Eleven? Why is a gambler talking about morals and kindness? Are you sick? He is right there. How did he miss it? Darn! Stop right there! Dad, why did you gamble away my money? What's wrong with you? The money at home is for household expenses. So I used it. The money is for my eye surgery. In future ask me first before you use the money. Ungrateful daughter! So dramatic. You think it's for real? Who is it? Are you looking for death? Yes, do you want to beat me? I should have known it was you. Only you have such a powerful punch. Hello, Mr Who-the-hell. You stole your daughter's medical fees so what's going to happen to her eyes? There hasn't been a cure for her eyes all these years. The doctors are only out to cheat her money. How can you say that? Don't worry, Miss. How much did your father take from you? $30,000. Hey, stop it.. There's only $20,000 left. This is my bet! From today onwards, I'll inform all bankers not to accept any bets from you. As for the bets you placed today, they're cancelled. Whatever, they are losing anyway. How about our bets? Can you cancel them too? Okay, I'll cancel all the bets made today. Bravo! What the heck? Are you sick? Chicken, I'm warning you... If you bet on football and horses again, I'll cut your hands off. You don't mean it, do you? Be careful. Get out. Thank you! You need not say thank you. My dad indulges in gambling because of people like you. How can you say that? —Forget it. —Let's go. Are you a philanthropist tonight? Come on! The match hasn't ended. Come and have a drink. Do you think Man United will win? Uncle, Man United did win! Life is unpredictable! I think you are fond of Candy. Yes! Let me check her background for you, okay? Why are you so nice to me? You know, I've always wanted to learn from you. You've already got it. Then take me as your student. Okay, if you help me to woo Candy, I'll teach you something. Do keep your words. You can count on me. If you let Jesus into your heart, you will never be lonely. Is that true? Candy, come here... Let me introduce a new friend to you. This is No-name. What a coincidence! You are... Candy, we met at the pub once. Pub? He is the guy who didn't allow your father to gamble. Oh, you know each other! Well, enjoy your chat. —I have to get going. —Thank you. Okay... thank you. Why did you come to this church? I was just walking by and suddenly I felt lonely. That's why I came in here. Have you been a Christian for long? Yes, a while now. Which church did you attend? Well, it's... a church in Cha-ko-ling. Are you called No-name? Yes. But I have another name that is very odd. It's Who-the-hell. It's odd. Well, I'll call you No-name. Sure. May I call you Candy? Sure, this is the name given by my mom before her death. What's your Christian name? —Peter. —Peter? You were named after the thirteenth disciple of Jesus. Yes. Jesus had thirteen disciples. Peter was one of them. So I chose that name. How old are you? I am twenty-eight. Jesus died when he was twenty-nine. You're one year younger then. That's right, Jesus died young. He was such a nice man. What a pity that he died at twenty-nine. Bruce Lee lived till thirty-three. Yes. Oh, I've forgot the name of Jesus' father. That carpenter... Yes, Carpenter, that's right. Right, his father's name was Carpenter. And his mom was Madonna. Is that true? You are not a Christian at all. Jesus only had twelve disciples. He died when he was thirty-three. His father was Joseph and his mother was Maria. —His brother was So... —Solskjaer. He had no brothers and sisters. Why do you trick me again and again? You skirt chaser! You skirt chasers only come to the church to woo Candy. It's a long queue, you know that? You are a Pastor. Why are you so cocky? So what? —Pastor, are you all right? —I'm fine. Even a pastor can ask for help. I preach in Mongkok. Of course I am prepared to have a couple of rascals joining us. Ko Fai and his boys are loyal members of our church. It'd be smart of you to leave at once. We Christians will not fight. But we can ask you to leave. I am sorry. If you are sincere in wanting to listen to the sermon, you are always welcome. I am sincere! But only to you. If you stop lying, we can be friends. Brother Who-the-hell. Don't call me Who-the-hell. Call me No-name, it sounds better. Brother No-name, you've become Candy's boyfriend. You said you would teach me how to swindle. Which kind of skills do you want to learn? It's tough anyway. I don't mind. All right. Seven. Seven. Seven again. Why so many sevens here? You need to practise more. Rolling dice is very important. It brings you tiles which you need. If you throw two dice out... before it stops, if the number you read isn't the one you want... throw the third one out at once but bring them back together. Just tell them that it's seven. You're great! And this is how to steal a tile. Usually, you have one tile more than the others. Why? That means you have a hidden tile. When you take your dominoes back bring one more for spare use. When you deal, you will also deal two dominoes You're great! Some masters can steal another two more at the same time. That means, they take three back and deal three at the same time. Really? How many do you deal at the same time? Why do you ask? That's none of your business. Practise hard. Where are you going now? I am going to dress up. I have a date with Candy tonight. What an amorous guy. Come on. This is my room. Have a feel of it. Besides me, can you feel anything else? I can feel myself. There are many pictures of you. I have to look at them every night before I can fall asleep. Many of my pictures? He even put up your posters on the wall. They're all sexy pictures. When I come in every morning, it's all wet. You scumbag! Don't hit me. —It's fragrant. —Hi... I'm... My name is Mee. Are you Uncle Lo's girlfriend? That's right. Come over here... but be careful. I am preparing dinner. Do you need my help? No, thanks. I prepare dinner all the time. I don't want to hurt you. Don't worry, I lost my eyesight when I was twelve. I am able to take care of myself. I can cook a very delicious duck dish. —Can you teach me? —Sure! It's time to eat! —Okay. —Do you dare to do this again? Let's discuss this matter some other time. Don't get smart with me. Ask him to suck his own toes. Boss, how can you treat me like this? This is your personal conflict. I am just giving you some suggestions. If you don't think it's good... I can lend him a stirring machine to fix you up. Oh no! Spare me, please. It hurts! Spare me, please! Okay, for your punishment you will have to forgo dinner. Go and serve the customers. Ask Chun back for dinner. Don't be so cruel to me, please. —What a huge spread! —Give him a break. Your wife is so nice to me! You boot-licker, go and ask Chun back for dinner. Let's have dinner. Have some pork ribs Candy, did your father steal your money again? No, I don't put money at home now. We earn less now because her father no longer gambles. This is a good deed. God will grant you and Mee a son. It's good! Are you going to America for your eye surgery? I haven't saved enough money yet. Don't worry, I'll help you. I won't use the money you earned from gambling. What you won... could be the money meant for some children's school fees. Or perhaps, the money was somebody's medical fees. Of course not! I only win money from rascals. —Boss. —What's the matter? Why doesn't he come for dinner? No, Mr Tough from Shenzhen is here. He brought many of his men along. So what's going to happen? Women should not meddle with a man's business. Continue with your dinner. I'll be back soon. Who is Mr Tough? I don't know. Let not meddle with a man's business. Come on, try this celery. Brother Tough, nice to meet you. Fatty, I didn't come for you. Are you looking for me? I did a check on you. You made a lot of money in Shenzhen during the past couple of months. But what's the use? You can't make big money from those small potatoes. If you join me, I promise you can make at least five million a month. In that case, my brothers can make three or four million a month, right? No problem. Ask them to come with you. I am rich enough to pay them. Thank you for your offer. If I say no, what will you do then? I'll make you say yes then. This is Hong Kong, not Shenzhen. Shut up! Don't get all agitated. I only said "if." If you don't join me and if I know you are making a living in Shenzhen... I'll chop off all your fingers. This is not an invitation to join you then. It is, that is if you agree to join me. There's no reason for me to turn down a money making opportunity then. I just realized that you are a handsome chap. You are the handsome one. No, you are more handsome. You are tough! Let's have a drink. Singleton? Brother Tough, he seems to be good at playing cards. He is my nephew. My luck isn't good these days. So I decided to send a newbie to fix you. Let's see whether you are a real newbie. Mr Handsome, mine is slightly bigger than yours. What's the hurry? Pretty girl, you don't need to deal such a big card now. —This is a straight flush. —Smart boy, go ahead and deal. Full-house of Aces. Do you have to go that far? It seems that you can read my card. This is yours, and this is mine. —Are you satisfied? —Yes. Uncle, this is yours. I didn't do anything. Next time, it's your turn to play. Thank you. —Chun, this is yours. —Thanks, brother. You gave very accurate information. I stared real hard. Since that was a big bet It was hard to cheat. Cheating in the form of reporting cards is the best way to win. Thank you, Mr Who-the-hell. Don't call me that. Candy doesn't like this name. —Call me No-name. —Brother No-name. You were named after the hero in a comic book. You like reading comics? Of course, I have to keep up with the times. Look! Why do you like listening to movies? I did watch movies before I was ten. The cinema was filled with laughter. The audiences were happy. When I lost my sight, I always asked my mother to take me to the cinema. I wanted to share in the happiness of the audiences. After my mother passed away, no one accompanied me to the cinema anymore. You have me now. If you want to come to the movies, I'll accompany you. Hey, No-name. Why isn't there much laughter in the cinema now? It's because not many people are interested in watching movies now. Why? Because they think it's no longer cool to go to the cinema now. A couple of years ago people started buying pirated VCDs. They feel that it's cheaper than going to the cinemas. So they started buying pirated stuff. Even though the Custom Department is clamping down on these offenders... many people have lost the passion for going to the cinemas. I understand that. It's just like love. When a couple sees each other everyday they don't want to be separated at all. But once they are separated for a while, even when they have the chance to stay together... the feeling would have totally changed. Is that right? So let's not leave each other. All right. —Are you working? —Yes. —Easy money. —Not as good as before. Aren't you ashamed at all? In fact, I love movies. But I need to make a living. You need to make a living. But the movie makers suffer instead. I am sorry. The offender was convinced of his wrong action. You fooled him. But he's gone too far. Don't you think you are just like him? I don't want you to gamble for a living. I just want to have a better life in the future. How about those who lost their money to you? Don't you think their family wants to live a better life too? You are committing the same crime too. Okay, I will stay true to my promise. When you come back from America after your eye surgery... that will be the day I stop gambling. Make sure you stay true to your promise. Lie to a woman and you will not prosper. Uncle Chicken. Why did you go into Candy's room? A rat ran in. I went in to kill it. I don't want Candy to be frightened by it. I'm not afraid of rats. I'm afraid of thieves. No, there are no thieves. I killed the rat and threw it out into the street. Do you want supper? I can go and get it. No, you'd better turn in. I won't bother you. You're welcome. I won't know anything once I fall asleep. I won't hear anything either. My daughter, you are so rich! What are you hiding? —Nothing. —Show me. Why are you so pathetic? Only a couple dollars in your account. There was a time I only had six dollars. Thank you. No gambling. I bought you a gift. What is it? It's a musical pendant watch. Is it expensive? It's cheap. I bought it from a boutique at the Macau pier. It's cute. You can hear the music. So I bought it for you I bought one for myself too. There's a reason why I bought it. When you come back from America after your eye surgery... When you hear this piece of music... You should know what to do next. Do you want me to marry you? There's no hurry, but... the least you can do is to come here to look for me. All right. Listen. Why are you so late? Brother Tough is hopping mad. I am sorry. I had some important work to do. Brother Tough, sorry I am late. No worries. Chun plays as well as you do. No? You'll lose four times the bet. What rotten luck! Here comes the virgin! Long-hair, you'd better get up. You are a jinx! Brother No-name, please have a seat. May I know your name? Mister Chicken is a businessman from Hong Kong. He is here to buy a factory. But he is down on his luck. He lost almost two million dollars. Two million dollars? He is a businessman. Two million is nothing to him. I am so tired today. It's your deal. A pair of threes. A pair of sixes. A pair of aces. A pair of fours. A pair of sevens. A pair of eights. A pair of tens. A pair of Js. Don't you have any pairs? Queen. Don't you have a pair of sevens? Two. The biggest two. Nine. King, last card. Ace. I won! I won at last. You lose double the bet. Why am I so tired today? Two full house. I've got it! Three of clubs. I won again! Sure win... Flush! I won! What's the matter with you, Mr Virgin? You are not lucky tonight. I said I was tired. Then you had better take a rest. Chun, come and play the game. I'm just kidding! I can make it. I am not kidding! Get up now! Everyone could tell that you kept giving him chances. Even the blind can tell it. I was late because I was looking for Candy's bankbook. That scumbag Chicken took her money. Luckily, he won two million back. I hope he won't lose it again. The bet is too small. It's not exciting at all. The bet is three thousand per card. Isn't that exciting enough? Why not make it $30,000 a card? And a side bet of $500,000 per game. Is it a deal? I'm game for it. Chicken, you are on a roll. Come on! I'd rather not. You won a couple hundred thousand dollars and you want to leave now? You should play at least another two more games. All right then. Chicken, you first. Okay! A pair of ace. It's big! You're lucky, aren't you? Not exactly. A pair of two. Three kings. What's the rush? Eight, nine, ten, J, Q, A , straight flush. I am sorry. Three of a kind... I win! You lost four times the bet. Brother Chicken, you lost triple the bet. Thirty-three multiplied $30,000... plus $500,000 for the side bet. The total is $1,490,000. Thank you. I want to quit now. You promised to play two games. A pair of nines. Go ahead and deal! A pair of tens. A pair of J. A pair of Queen. —A pair of King. —A pair of Ace. A pair of twos. A, K, Q, J, ten. Straight flush. Planning to save cards in your bank? A pair of threes. I win. You lost four times the bet. That's 1.56 million. Plus $500,000 for the side bet. The total is $2.06 million. Please pay up. I don't have that much money! Write me an IOU note then. —You swindlers! —What did you say? You lost and then you call us swindlers? I can't lose the money. My daughter needs the money for her medical fees. Get him! Who-the-hell, stay where you are. You think I didn't notice that you gave him a chance to win? I knew it already. This is our family business. As for your money, I'll deal with you later. Leave now. I shan't bother you then. Brother Tough, take it easy. He didn't mean to. He didn't mean to? No one dares to fool me in Shenzhen. Scumbag! Uncle, run! Run! Leave me! Run! Get up! Beat him up! You mess up with me? Please stop beating him! He's still young. He doesn't know the rules. Don't beat him. Beat me up if you want. All right, give them a good lesson! —Brother Tough... —Where is Chicken? He ran to the rooftop and jumped to his death. Let's go! Well done! Come work for me, okay? No-name... No-name... Answer me! You are scaring me! Help... No-name... Wake up! Please don't die! Uncle Lo, why don't you switch on the light? It's daytime. Am I blind? I don't know. Why? Who caused me to go blind? Where is the doctor? Ask the doctor to come here! —Doctor... —Mr Lo... Mr Lo, please be calm. We've checked your X-ray film. We discovered that there is a blood clot in your eye nerves. That's why you can't see. When will I recover? We need some time. You might need an operation. Don't do that! No-name, we won't let you lose your sight. You won't be blind! Candy will leave tomorrow, right? She will leave for America tomorrow. But Chicken took all her money. Don't worry, I sold the bar and the house. The money is enough for her surgery. You sold all your property. What's going to happen to you? I'm smart enough to make a living. I'm smart enough to make a living. Uncle. Please call Candy for me. No-name. I lost my pass-book. Maybe you put it somewhere else. You'll be able to find it somehow. I've already deposited money into your account. You can pay me back the money when you return. Where are you now? I'm in Shenzhen. A rascal wants to discuss business with me. I know I have to stop gambling. It'd be great if you do. I will. Will you see me off tomorrow? Sure, I will come. Candy. I love you. Me too. Candy. Where is No-name? He is in Shenzhen. He lost his passport so he can't come back. He asked me to pass you the money. Why is he so careless? Don't worry. He promised to call you when you arrive in America. It's time to leave now. It's time for you to board the plane. Bye. One more glass, please. Stop drinking. You had enough. What else can I do besides drinking? Brother Lo asked me to stop you from drinking too much. Let me buy him drinks then. Why so sullen? Are you really blind? I don't believe it. Why are you here? Can't I come? Why are you staring at me? I wasn't the one who beat you up. The guys from Shenzhen didn't like you, so they beat you up. You must have done too many bad things. It was payback time. I'm different. I did so many bad things but I'm fine. You have such a useless head. Just hit it a couple of times and you lose your sight. Stand up! Tough Ho, you are not in Shenzhen. Your nephew started the fight first. My friends were only helping me. What if he hits my head and I go blind? —Mee, call the police. —Why? You are not welcome here. Why can't I visit my own pub? What did you say? Who do you think you sold your pub to? —I bought it. —You... I bought it through a middleman. You are such a fool. Move with the times, Fatty. You think you are smart? I always thought so. Now I am making a living with Brother Tough, I feel great! That blind scumbag was stupid to betray Tough. I am stupid... Stupid enough to teach scum like you how to swindle. You are not stupid. But you are a skirt chaser. If you were not so caught up with wooing that blind girl... You would not have imparted your skills to me. I am not going to thank you at all. Uncle, let's go. It's now five to twelve. Your shop will be mine soon. If you don't leave by then, I'll chase you out. Scum, why are you following him? Come work for me. I'll pay your double. Double pay? Save it for your coffin instead. Lo, where are you going? I am going to kill Chun, that scumbag! You are no match for him. Put it down. I don't give a hoot. —Boss, I'll go with you! —No. Wake up, guys! Uncle, we lost. All this while, Chun was making plans to get rid of me. But we didn't realized it. He is really smart. Why do we have to kill him? But I am really mad! Our pub is gone. And the flat will be gone too. We'd better think of a place to stay. No-name, why don't you teach me your skills instead? If you can teach Chun, you can teach me too. When I could still see, it wouldn't have been a problem. Uncle, I can't teach you now. Let's not think of gambling anymore. Let's get a proper job, okay? I don't want to live like a loser in front of those scumbags! Let's get a proper job then. And make sushi with you? Candy! —Sue? —Yes. You look great. Let's go. I'll show you around Hong Kong. Well, I have a question for you. When I went to America for my eye surgery... No-name didn't call me at all. Did something happened to him? I don't know. But they seem to have disappeared. So this is the place? Why isn't anyone here? I think it just opened. How can I help you? We are looking for No-name. Candy, you are here to look for No-name? You know me? I am Chun. Where is Who-the-hell? He hasn't been here since he lost his sight. What did you say? I haven't seen him since he lost his sight. How did he lose his sight? I heard that he got beaten up and there's a blood clot in his brain. I feel so sorry for him. But this is fate. When your dad died in Shenzhen he was there too. But I don't know if he had anything to do with it. Isn't he living upstairs? He sold the flat to me. Do you know where is he now? I don't know. He changed his phone number. Let's go. Well, since you are here. Let me give you a treat. No, thanks. If you hear from him, please call me. Of course. Shall I drive you around to look for him? No, thanks. I don't like it when others are too kind to me. When I was young, I was bullied by dirty old men. One day you'll be mine. Christ Disciples Church Jesus... Jesus is in my heart. Jesus... —Candy. —Jesus... —Pastor. —You're back! I can see now. Congratulations! Can I ask you for a favour? Speak up. Have you seen No-name? Yes... but he's in trouble. I know. But I don't know where he is now. He left just before you came. Do you know where he's staying now? I don't know. Let me find him for you. As long as he is in Hong Kong, I'll definitely be able to find him. Thank you, brother Ko-fai. Fatty, how dare you cheat in my place? I'll beat you up. —It's just a misunderstanding! —Beat him up. Don't you dare cheat again. —It hurts! Stop it! —How dare you cheat me! —Don't hit my hands! —Stop! —Hit the other hand! —I won't cheat again. Hit the other hand! Uncle, you can sweet talk women. But you can't make a living with your hands. We have downgraded to a hut. It'll be demolished next month. Where are we going to stay then? Why not look for a proper job? Stop nagging, please. Don't you have to go to work? I have something to tell you. What is it? Well, I want to tell you that the Japanese chef... He is a nice man. Recently, he asked me out. Do you want to go? —Well, I'll go tell him... —Don't! I'm not interested anyway. I just want you to live a peaceful life. You want me to stop gambling, right? It's not that. Do you want to fight and gamble all your life? Frankly, I don't like to be beaten to a pulp. Don't you get it? I'm not asking you to marry me at once. Neither do I want you to buy me expensive gifts. I just want to be an ordinary person. Whenever you leave for Shenzhen, I suffer from sleepless nights. You knew I was a swindler from day one. If you can't accept my lifestyle then it's too bad for you. You can date the Japanese chef... and as for me, I will take revenge for No-name. Uncle, forget about taking revenge. It is a fact that I am blind. We cannot live like before. Why are you so frank? Why can't you just flatter me? When a person has no hope... he is as good as dead. Don't wait for him anymore, Mee. Stop being his second choice. His first choice is gambling. No-name. I am back. I am Candy. You've got the wrong person. No! Listen to this music. I recognize your voice. Do you recognize mine? So what if I do? So what if I am No-name? Everything is different now. I am blind. Just like you were before. It doesn't matter. You kept me company when I was blind. What do you mean? I was a swindler! Eyesight matters to a swindler. When I was blind, you went out with me. Now that you are blind, we can listen to movies and hang out together. Do you want to listen to the movies and hang out with me everyday? Don't we have to work? Are you going to support me? You want me to take money from a women? No. What is it then? —Please let me stay with you. —What for? Please don't be so selfish. You want to see me but I don't want to see you. I don't want you to see me when I am down and out. Go away! Go away! If you want to see me, give me a call. Pastor, what should I do? I don't know what your values in life are. It's right to get back what's yours. When I was beaten up in Shenzhen... I asked God why he didn't save me. But no one answered me. At last, I finally understood... only you can save yourself. That's right. In fact, I don't want to take revenge. But if I don't take back what's mine... I will not have the confidence to do anything in the future. You want to gain your confidence back, right? Yes. I have decided to stand on my own two feet again. If I want to win, I have to be ruthless and merciless. That's how a swindler should be. I don't agree with your methods. But I agree that if you want to win, you must do your best. Or else don't do it. I see your point. No-name, I agree that you should take back what belongs to you. If regaining my eyesight means losing you, I'd rather remain blind forever. He can make it. He is good at reading the tiles with his fingers. Did he win a lot of money? He is saving money. I think he is going to do something big. He wants to take revenge on me and Brother Tough? I don't know. Did he suspect you? I put such a great act on that night you took over his pub. He will never know that I am the betrayer. Did he play poker? —Yes, he plays the Big Two. —How can he read the cards? Fatty sat next to him and told him the cards. If Fatty isn't around, how can he read the cards? Fatty is always with him. But if he isn't around, I will be the only one left. Be careful, I've won nine consecutive times. Fifty thousand. Shut up. I won. You guys are going to pay a fortune for this game. Each of you lost forty-four folds. Are you kidding me? Why did you want one instead of three kinds? Are you really blind? Even if I could see, I wouldn't have known what you wanted. You dealt a pair of fifty thousand one eighty thousand and one ninety thousand. Whenever you feel the domino, you will spend more time than usual. That means you want forty and seventy thousand. Oh no, I'm going bankrupt tonight. But this is only a small bet. It's not a small bet, mister. Brother No-name, it's Chun. I can recognise his voice. If you are losing, you better stay calm. Get lost. But I'm the banker. So what? I just want to play a part. It's okay. Well, if I lose, I'll pay for their share too. No-name, are you making a comeback? Yes, I want to take back what is mine. I am worried you might lose your life. Then I don't have to worry about making a living. You're right. —How many points? —Seven. Thank you. It's important to control the points of the dice. It can affect your chances. Do you want a smoke? I don't want yours, I have my own. West. —Scumbag! —What did you say? No-name, you seem to have more tiles than normal. Really? —I don't. —Yes, it's correct. You want four and seven bamboos? Lucky me. I know the last seven bamboos are on the top of the thirteenth row. And the four bamboos is at the end. Four circles. One circle. Two circles. It's hard to feel. Flower. Same thing. What? You can't feel it? Flower again. Six flowers. It's hard to feel. South. Take your time, there are many tiles left. You've got all the tiles that I want. The flowers won't bring me luck. Bad luck! Thirty thousand. I want it. Four of a hidden kind. Flower. Four of a hidden kind again. Two flowers. Sorry, you can't win the grand slam without these two flowers. Seventy thousand. I draw it myself. What did you draw? Four bamboos. Didn't you say you would pay for them? You are amazing! No, you are even more amazing. Do you have the guts to place a bigger bet? I have been waiting all night for this invitation. Three days later, I'll bring Mr Yiu of the Hung Hing group to be the judge. Remember to ask your master along. Okay, I'll wait for you. Pay him the money. Candy. I'm home, Candy. Smells good. What are you cooking? Candy. I'm home, Candy. Is he really blind? Blind man, I am sorry! Darn you, I will kill you after winning all your money. No-name, it's me! What's the matter? Who hit me? A thief broke into our flat. I just came out from the toilet. The thief got scared and ran away. Are you all right? I am fine Thank God, I won't let anyone hurt you. You scumbag! Your playing is awful! Stop it. Brother Yiu, how's your boss, Mr Chiang? Mr Chiang spends most of his time in Europe. Let's cut to the chase. I am here to be a judge. Are they your people? They are Mr Chiang's friends. You can choose to ignore the rules for your friend. Only the most powerful gang can have the final say. It's rude of you to say that. I am a fair guy. But if you want to be brutal, I won't yield. I know you are powerful in Shenzhen and Zhuhai. So whatever you say goes. We became powerful because we are fair. If we were bullies, we would have been eradicated. So we are here to ensure that this is a fair game. No-name will gamble with your man. No tricks allowed. I'm not afraid of this blind fool. I'm just afraid that he has no money. Mr Chiang will be his guarantor for fifty million HK dollars. I see, so he's giving me money. That's great! All right, let's have a game here this Saturday night. —Let's play poker. —All right. He is blind yet you want to play poker. You're obviously taking advantage of him. Uncle, it's all right. Let's play poker. I want them to be utterly convinced. This Saturday we'll play till dawn. The game will end at six in the morning. Let's leave now. Scum, have you considered it carefully? If you don't want to go with us, I won't blame you. Who do you think I am? I am a righteous guy! That's my buddy! Candy, don't go with us, it's dangerous. I want to. If you ask me to stay at home... What if I receive a call saying that you're dead? Listen, I don't want you to take any risk. Please don't go. I won't be a burden to you. Uncle, let's go. I want to see Mee. She has been with me for years. I shouldn't leave without a word. What if I die? I don't think a righteous man should do that. Best wishes to the bride. Best wishes to the bridegroom. $500,000. He's got two sixes, he has a pair. He asked for $500,000. Go ahead, but I want a double. Do you think I only have two sixes? I have a pair of Aces too. Do you want to see my card? Make it three million. Okay, I'll go. Deal. —He's got an eight. —How about me? Eight too. We have a pair of eights. It's your say. How much is on the table? Do you want a show-hand? I don't give a hoot! Show-hand. Why is he so confident? If he has no confidence, why did he ask for another three million? If he has three eights, I would be trapped. It's going to be a long night. I'll let you win this game. —I quit! —Smart boy. It would be worse if you didn't revoke. Three eights. No-name, it's a ten, not eight. Are you kidding me? You told me that it's an eight. Sorry, I made a mistake. Luckily he revoked. We are lucky indeed! Cheung, play a happy song for me. I'll give you a three thousand dollar tip. Thank you! Congratulations! You have a baby! Are you looking for trouble? Darn! Brother Tough, don't vent your anger on young kids. I won't give him any more tips, okay? Change the cards. He hit me. Brother Tough, if we go on like this, we will be at a disadvantage. There are so many Hung Hing men around. What can we do? You sit here and think how we are going to celebrate our victory. I am going to take a leak. We must win... Don't move! Drop the knife. You want to ambush me in the toilet? I can do the same too! Get in. Don't lie to me. I must take revenge for No-name. Brother Yiu, is my uncle back? I've asked Scum to look for him. Brother Yiu, we can't find Lo in the toilet. I quit. Where has that Fatty gone to? He wants to flee with the money? No-name, I'll ask my men to search for him. How about asking Scum to help you? That's my only choice. Brother No-name, don't worry. I have a bad feeling. Uncle wouldn't leave without a reason. Don't think about it. Let's finish the game first. Deal. Brother No-name, you've got an Ace of spades. Let me see the covered card? No! Show-hand. What? This is the first card. I never thought of leaving this place alive. Why not make a big bet? I'm not as crazy as you. There is an hour until six. I'll do it for every game. No guts to do it? You betrayer! Okay, what's the big deal? He's got an Ace. But we have a pair of Aces. Deal. We have a king of spades. He has a king of hearts. Mine is bigger. —Deal. —Hang on. —I want to raise the bet. —What is the raise? —Your life. —What do you mean? I think Uncle Lo may be dead... Plus what you did to me in the past... I want to bet my life with yours. If I lose, I'll jump from the rooftop just like Chicken did. If you lose... I want your eyes. At the most, it's only a king. We are playing the last card. I won't give in to him. All right, I want your life now! No-name, you are dead. All right, I'll bet with your life. Deal. He's got a seven of diamonds. —No-name, let me see your card. —No! Let's see it together. It's a king, brother No-name. I saw it! I know it's a king. And I saw you giving me another card. You want me to lose. And I can see a heartless scumbag standing in front of me! You scumbag, you can actually see! Didn't anyone tell you that he has recovered? Did you think I would be blind for the rest of my life? On the seventh day after I was hospitalized the blood clot was removed by laser. On the thirteenth day, I could see again. You pretended to be blind. If not, I don't think I would have survived. I would have been killed by you. So I used that betrayer. Otherwise, how could you believe me? I didn't see it at all. If it was two, three, four, five, six, I would die. If it was seven, eight, nine, ten, J, Q, then you'll be blind. Let God determine our fate. You betrayer! Brother Tough, kill him! You should admit defeat! You're right. If I lose I have to pay with my eyes. It's you who wanted to gamble with him. That's none of my business. Don't get me involved. Don't move... Are you crazy? How can I not be crazy? Move it! Drop the knife. Be rational. Do you want to see the covered card? I won't let you see it. I want you to die with regrets. He is dead. My money is on the table. Show me your card. I haven't raised my bet yet. What else can you bet for? I want to bet your wiener. If I win, leave your wiener behind. If you win, I'll leave mine. —You... —Shut up if you have no guts. You are gutsy! Let's go. This is a big bet. Can I see the card? Uncle Lo was found stabbed to death in the back alley. I'm sorry! Candy. You can see me. You saw them raping me that night, right? When you are with me you are also a swindler. I wanted to take revenge. Congratulations, you got your revenge. Goodbye. You're back. Where are Lo and the rest of them? Aren't you getting married today? I decided not to. I don't love that person at all. I saw Lo. I could tell from the look in his eyes that he loves me. I've been waiting for him the whole night. But he did not come home. They are gambling in Shenzhen. —Did he win? —Yes. That's great! Then why aren't they back yet? Something happened. They have to lie low for a while. Where are they now? They said that they would contact me as soon as possible. I'll fill you in again, okay? All right. If Lo calls you, tell him that I am not married. I will wait for him to come back. Okay. I'm going home.
