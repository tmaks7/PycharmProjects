Yeah, let's go. Let's go. Come on. We know that you are a CIA agent. How did you find us? Contesta! Answer the question. Contesta! Contesta! Answer the question. Answer the question. Who do you work for? I protected you so long for my men. You've got to give me something. I don't know what you're talking about. You really want to die here today? What do you know about us? How many of you are there? If you don't talk, then I no longer have no use for you. Go, go! Go, go, go! Go, check it out, go, go, go, go. Yeah, I got the package. No. The money's OK. Long way from the field. Hey, old friend. What do you want, George? It's a brutal nature of mine. Many have tried to control it. Others simply wish to let it free. I didn't mean to interrupt. But... Mystery told me that you hadn't been home for a couple of weeks. Yeah. Putting that pension to good use. Again, what do you want? This is where I mention it's really a good use of a man with your talents. Better than throwing bodies for you. I suppose. There's a target. Who's the target? One that we need neutralized. Not interested. Find someone else. Our governments are engaged in rather dangerous game of roulette, so nuclear kind. Once again, I'm not interested. You could fuck off. Clean records, an honorary medal, and-- and Carl Miller. We have his whereabouts. I could have left you in that POW camp long ago. But I knew the time would come our paths will cross again. The plane for Frankfurt departs at 0600 in three days. Trust you understand. It's a time sensitive nature. Your assignment. Always knew I could count on you, old friend. How do you know he's going to be there? It will be as it should be, the details. They don't tell you that places like this aren't for people like us, Eddie. During World War II, group of US soldiers were sent on a Black Ops diversion mission to retrieve files from a concentration camp, Ravensbruck. I know the name. Yeah. That's just the Sunday paper edition. Do we have anybody on the inside? That's the thing. My department feels we can help each other out. I'm listening. Rachel Colin, traffic from Bulgaria, spent some time with some MIA sleeper cell boys out in England, got herself caught in a bilateral hostage situation with some countries that normally don't play nice with each other. How did you manage that? An online human trafficking ring run by Carl Mueller. Now normally, you don't give a shit what and Carl do when it's off time. But Mueller's made some interesting friends, friends the Pentagon believes are sitting on a rich base of plutonium. When were these pictures taken? By one of our ally's satellites. Now, Carl is close with a discharged veteran you may know. I can't confirm without knowing what my department gains from all of this. Vanona. Vanona? Our person on the inside was captured by a militia group. Now this militia group is helping Mueller move the plutonium. They're calling themselves the Children of Hitler's Resistance, the Fourth Reich. Now, Rachel is the only one who can show us where the plutonium is. Everyone thinks they can run the country anyway. And their voices are getting harder and harder to silence. Vanona's on the inside. What do you need with my guy? He has ties with Carl Mueller. Murdered his wife. And we believe that can motivate a man. So I'm going to send my guy to Germany? I want you to send a team. No tags. No affiliation to us or any of our mutual interests. They are going to go into Ravensbruck and destroy the information, information that dates back to the Second World War. While they do that, Vanona will locate and extract Rachel. We'll hand over to the CIA. Everybody wins. Doerflinger is the only one who can get the ear of Noah. I want to know what kind of research. No, you don't, Eddie. That research gets out, we'll have more to worry about that plutonium. Good to see you, Sony. Come on, Seth. Get those legs moving. Keep them. Keep them churning, buddy. Get those legs moving for me. Come on, buddy. The domestic life seeks you. There are no bookies here, Noah. What do you want? Just want to talk. Showers, give me 10 laps on the way out. Last time I talked to you, you're just sniveling little fingers in my sister's purse. Better than her pants. You're going to hear me out? And I'll let you get back to your Stepford wife routine. Hands on where it begins and-- Do it again. Pass me the hooch. You think after 10 years I can finally wingman you to a score? Here's to hoping. That rodeo is long gone, cowboy. Chicago will never fly. That, I promise you. You don't know her like I know her. She just wants your name cleared. Shit, we all do. Sometimes, it's best to leave ghost in the grave. You know what I'm saying. Anybody ever tell you, you talk too much? All the time. But they never accuse me of being wrong. So I think we should go get Eric. So I stick it, too. Wow this place has a lot of shit. It's been shit. Actually. Not bad. Could be worse. Cody, Cody, Cody, how are you doing? Cody. Uh-uh. He does not want to see you. Him or me? It's definitely not me. Come on. You're being ridiculous. Hey, Eric. All we want to do is talk. Come on, man. Hey, Eric. He told me to tell you that he still has not forgot. Serious? Hey, Eric. We just want to talk. Definitely not talking. Come on, man. You're being ridiculous. All I want to do is talk. Maybe you should apologize. What? What? Really? Just saying, maybe it'd make him feel better. Eric, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sleep with your sister. Mother. And his ex-wife. And your ex-wife. Didn't expect to see you, Sharona. How's the boys doing? They're doing great. We're 2 and 11. Come on. What's that? That is me telling my friends I'm buying whatever bullshit you're selling. I didn't ask you anything you. Don't need to. Sharona is my friend. Cody is my friend. You, Noah, you are an early exit. I got a job that's going to help the whole team. All they need is 10 minutes. I tell you what. You got until I finish my drink and if I like what you have to say. Northern Germany. I trust you fellas can show yourself out. Record expunged. Reenlistment. She got on board? It was her idea. That's a lie. Is it legal? Yep. Across the board. Another lie. See, this is what you do, Noah. You come in here and get everyone riled up. But not this time. You're the best technician I know. Only. You're the only technician I know. It's a high elusive target. We don't have much time to plan. Sorry, boys. I'm sitting this one out. So what do you think? I think we're fucked if Eric doesn't write those schematics. Yeah. Well, what about Parker? Parker? Fuck no. He's the best and you know it. If you want to get us all killed, you call fucking Parker. Fuck. Schroeder, what's this just really about? We need him. We can use him. Right. Get the truck. That's mine. You dumb bitch. Flossenberg, the concentration camp I created. But experimental man reaches futility in nature. Our mission-- We were to drop with the 68 battalion in military capacity, but secretly. We were a covert special ops unit charged to infiltrate Ravensbruck to protect US interests, sir. I'm not at liberty to divulge, sir. I am aware, sir. I'm fully aware of the consequences, sir. I love my country. and it's whereabouts are in their best interest, sir. dictionary. Not having no fun with words, you know what I'm saying? Suck my balls, man. The alphabet alphabet. Are you new here? --kind of crazy. Your brain's Yeah, I'm pretty sure you are, right? That's what I'm saying. You have people acting crazy and shit. It's just business, all right? You feel me? My bad. I just want to make sure we have an understanding, see? Around here, they call me White Ice. What's your name? Move your foot or I'll move it for you. Yeah. Yeah. My bad I feel you. Back there, I just wanted to forget when I saw your face, to pretend. When Alice died, I was so sorry. Hell, we all were. Are you sure this isn't just going to leave a black mark on her name, her memory? What are you asking, Schroeder? What I'm asking is if this is a real mission or your chance just to do it all over again? Come on, man. I'm serious. Last time, all you saw was Alice's killers, every last one of them. I will ask again. Do you believe in this mission? I served my country for 15 years. And I put an extremist six feet under. My country let me down. It took away the one thing I cared about on this earth, the one person didn't think I was another jarhead. And right now, I have the opportunity to get that son of a bitch that killed her and stop a nuclear war. So yeah, Schroeder, I believe in this fucking mission. OK. What's going on here? What's going on is you two looking ass clowns are invited to our final days. Final days? What the hell is he talking about? The psycho says today, he's going to kill himself. Hey! Hey! You do know that they are recording everything that you say. Yeah. That's right. So I'd be a bit more subtle about the details. It all ends today, boys. Yep Parker-- And you are right on time. Parker, cut the shit. We got a gig. Baby, I make myself clear. I don't give a shit what you have, because today, is the last day that I'm going to be spinning my wheels on this side, on this side. I've heard enough. Parker, fuck you. I'll be in the truck. Fuck you, too, Schroeder. Parker. Now, you see right there, that's the man who gets it. Parker, we need a demolition specialist. Well, you're just going to have to find another, my friend. $15 million each. I'll get my bags, underwear, stuff like that. Grab a coffee. I told you not to fuck with my money, son. I worked the streets. I made the money. So fuck you, Ice. Goddamnit, you spent all my fucking money. I work hard but that's it. I want it all, all right? Every fucking penny, that's mine. Let's see you survive on the streets-- But it's mine. --without my protection. I know you've been watching me. I don't know her. Shut the fuck up, bith. There's a lot of people that want me to give you that money so we could look the other way and get the fuck out. If not, I can off this bitch in return. What do you think about that? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck you. Hey. What am I supposed to do? Hey, I don't know what to do. Your phone. You were at the Shut-Eye Cafe. I saw you. Be quiet. This place belongs to the militia. What the hell? Why would the militia be after me? Don't know. Hey, that's my money. Burn it. Marked bills. I don't understand. What do you mean? Hey, what are you doing? What am I supposed to do? Do you have a computer? Yes. Yeah. Let me grab my bag. All right. OK, I won't grab my bag, geez. Hey, well, what do I do now? Burn the money. What do you want, Noah? Oh, nice to see you, too. Can you not point that thing to me? Where is he? I don't have a clue of what you're talking about. Don't fuck with me, Noah. Where your right hand snake charm son of a bitch, your friend Schroeder? Can we just put it down, please. I told you not to show your face again around me, you son of a bitch. It's going to be worth your time. Let's talk about this. Hear me out, please. Oh. Mr. Schroeder. Parker it's good to see you, friend. Good to see you. Out of curiosity, have you-- No. You haven't told him anything, huh? No. Smart. Cowardly, but smart. You've always been a man of good timing, haven't you? It would be my recommendation that you do tell someone, maybe a medical professional, psychiatrist or therapist or something, about that time when you gave up all of your friends to save your own ass. You know, I... I got to tell you, man, that was one hell of a stunt that you pulled. Thanks, Parker. I'll strongly consider it. Just for your own mental sanity. You know. Oh, hell. Here we go. My money's got to be on Chicago. OK. I've got to say. Look, I know, Noah, a long time and he ain't no slouch. He's got this. Oh, come on, guys. Give me a little credit. You hear something, Parker? It's kind of impressive. I don't hear shit, actually. What'd I miss? It's just getting started. Long walk. Man, oh, man. All that frustration after 10 years. Cody put a tracker on my truck. Right. And I realize you boys can keep your right foot out of your left foot's way. Rookies. But wake me up when they start making out. Eric, you-- you still working at that diner, bussing tables and shit? Dude, fuck off. Just a question. Genuinely wanted to know how you're doing. It's been a long time. It's all good. How's the layout? Yeah. Fuck off, sleeping. The coffee in this place is probably made of motor oil. But it tastes so good. Hey, what are you doing with those? Do you know this girl? No. I'll ask you again. Have you seen this girl? Look, I've looked up to a lot of people, never forgot a face. It's one of my worst talents. So no. I'm sorry. I don't know her. I know you were a CIA. You're a FBI. Son of a bitch. We believe this girl is the only one who can lead us to the last known location of the plutonium. That's impressive. But I'm not CIA. Then why does an American agent have you on his phone? Why don't you just broadcast it to the entire fucking world? I have your email, real address, and name. Should I go on? All right, all right. Her name is Rachel. They never tell us the full name, some sort of torture prevention. All I know is she's involved in some dark psych program called Ravensbruck. This guy named Ice met up with-- what's his name, guy named Ivory? Ravensbruck, what do you know about it? Not much, just that it used to be a concentration camp, women's only during the World War. Some fucked up and creepy shit went on there what are you doing with those? White Ice had a meeting with Ivory in five minutes. You're not Ice. He would never speak with you I'm betting they never met or spoke in person. What makes you say that? We meet our contacts visually only if it's the first time in public places like this. Take this flash drive. Report everything that you have seen here back to your handler. Tell them to get you out. Are you serious? Once I extract Rachel, that plutonium could be in play. You want to be out of this place before them. Can I help you? Ivory seems like a dignified name, don't you think? I'm Ice. What do you have on Ravensbruck? It used to be a concentration camp, deep cover, highly classified. The Nazis have control of it now. Why? Using it for leverage. They want to bring about a new era, returning Germany to its glory days. Plutonium has a way of making people feel empowered. Listen, are you guys pulled me out, because this different handler shit is going to get me ghost. What about? What about? He's being detained outside Ravensbruck. It's in the dossier. Hey. Who's going to relieve me? Shit. This place we're going, there's history behind it, used to be a concentration camp. But the German, US, and Russian government will have you believe this is where they took prisoners, a few rounds of torture. But the true story behind this place, the purpose of this place was to experiment of enhance genetic code on newly born specimens, meant to breed a weapon war. By weapon, would it mean some type of super soldier program? Well, that's one way to describe it. But more of, how do we perfect what's already there? Enhance, make a more agile, more of where type program. So we're supposed to go into a foreign territory to shut down a secret program that doesn't officially exist? No. No, no, no, no, no, no. We go in, find, locate the research. It sounds so simple. Why don't the Germans do it themselves? Well, the compound is under control of Jurgen Schmidt, a neo-Nazi apologist, an all around asshole. He has created a mixed movement of extremists, hell bent. I stop in the grand placement. Wow. This one's a bit too heavy for a bunch of lug nuts like us. Eric, don't be such a pussy. Guys, this shit, this is worth sticking around for. We're talking anarchy, friends. We are talking about stopping the next great World War. Noah, you are-- fuck it, man. You are one hell of a fucking American. Noah. I'm afraid. Something about this don't sit right. Something's definitely off. I think it's a great idea, lays it out. Hey, everyone. It's Black Ops. We're talking low brow, high profile, behind enemy territory shit. If we get pinched, they're going to raise our names from the goddamn yearbook like we never fucking existed. So no, this isn't a great plan. And no, I don't have all the answers. But unless you're willing to die up on that hill of no pension, and co-ed health care, and a giant fuck you the government gave us, be my guest. One job, one job and we're set. No more dishonorable discharge, no more soccer games, no more pool target practice. I'm in, but it has to be all of us. That's fine, all of us or not. Fuck it. I always want to travel again. Well, blowing up a couple Nazis seems like a pretty good way to go. I'm in. It's been an honor. 0, 600 hours. We report. Is it cool if I take my whiskey back, though? It's the last one I got. Dude, well, finish it tonight. Thank you. Are you serious? Throw it back in when it's finished. You guys hungry? There's some fish sticks in the back thawing out. Hand me the bottle. Here's to herpes, my friend. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. I hear 'em chatting-- Hey, cut that shit off. --talking. I hear 'em chat with the boys, man so tough but mans keep walking. Dress too sharp with the poise, white girls love to tell me. Three bogies inside. We have another the problem. What you do now, Eric? Well, all the guards on this side are dead. No bodies, cowboy. Yeah, well, here's the thing. I ain't the one who off them. What the fuck? Somebody talk to me. Clear. Noah. The fuck? Guys, we have another familiar. I don't know if he's friendly or not. So they moved it all out this morning. Not possible. My contact assured me the information would be there. What do you want to? Come again? Whatever you are going to do, better do it fast. Let's not get caught holding the bag. What's say you, fellas? Fuck. Parker, how are we doing on the escape route? Same thing on this side. Fire in the hole. Something ain't right. No. No, it's not. You were meant to take the fall. If I wanted you dead, it would be so. Who are you? What was your mission? Noah, we need to make tailwind fast. You're the reason why these men are dead here? You will join them if you do not tell me your mission. Finding to locate at all the research. What type of research? The secret kind. Look, we had burn this whole place down and get the hell out of here. It is me that they want. I will stay and learn why. Awesome. Let's go. Good luck with that. Gotcha motherfucker. I have been made. Moving. Here, come on, boy. Rachel I'm here to get you out of here. Hey, hey. We gotta get to your vehicle now. Where is Schroeder? I don't know. I haven't seen him. I'll go back for him. Parker, you go ahead. If you don't see us, you need to get home. Yes, sir. Let's go. Schroeder. Brother. There, you see they name a trophy after me. This is the one that tell you about. That's a mere flesh wound. Listen. You go after her. You hear me? You go after her. You go after her, OK? You hear me? Go after her. Don't talk like that, brother. Listen, well, I gave you up. I was betraying you when I gave the team up. Hey, we're going to kill all of us. Hey, hey. Stop. Listen. You fucking listen to me. I had no other choice. I didn't know what to do, and I'm sorry. I'll see you on the other side. Love you, brother. I love you, brother. I am aware that the asset is no longer retained. The CIA is questioning Rachel as we speak. What I want to know is who leaked her whereabouts? You were supposed to deal and get a handle on this. This is why I put you on the seat you're in now, so that we would avoid these mistakes. Listen, I did what I always do. I clean up your shit, your shit. This isn't on me. Rachel found out where the plutonium was hidden. Do you have any idea how dangerous this would have been? Yes. Luckily, her deposition will never see the light of day. But we can forget about diplomacy. Now, what did you discover about Ravensbruck? I think it's time we re-evaluate our relationship. Listen to me, you inbred son of a bitch. I am CIA. One call-- hello? Oh, shit.
