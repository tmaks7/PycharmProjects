Open your eyes wide. Come on. Open them really wide. Yes... Don't smile like that. You'll be bullied if you do that. Look fierce! Yes, don't let anyone bully you. Yes, that's it! Yes. Don't play with water or you'll catch a cold. —I got it. —Wash the clothes too. Wash them while you're showering, okay? Okay. Dry and hang the clothes afterwards, okay? Okay! Wash them while I'm showering. Wash them while I'm showering... You little rascal. Okay, I know. What? I need more time to consider. —No... —Mum, where can I dry myself? I can't dry myself. Just turn on the rice cooker when you get hungry tonight. You can eat the rice once the steam comes out. —Do you know how to do it? —Yes. —Do you know how to turn it on? —Yes. Good boy. Press on the rice cooker. Press on the rice cooker... Why isn't there any steam? Where's the steam? Ah Fai, I'll give you candy if you call me Mum. Mum... Michael Jackson! Let me treat you to some candy. It's a small world after all... Your mother is going to get married. She's going to abandon you. Your mother is getting married... —Stupid pig... —No, you're stupid. You fool. Come here! Don't even think about bullying me! Go away! Goodbye, Michael Jackson. Hey, Uncle. Are you sick? You are drinking cough syrup again? Come and have your face read. You won't ever be rich if you don't have your face read. One can't mature without experience. Your material life is predestined. —You'll get rich when... —Uncle Ying! —Where's Siu Beng? —I've told you many times. You'll scare me to death if you pat my shoulder like this. —Are you heartless? —I'm going to find Siu Beng. Fai... —I'm going to find Siu Beng. —Come on, have a seat. Folks, let me give you a good example. Come on...Turn your head. Folks, this is a face blessed with good luck. Let me explain why it's a face blessed with good luck. This face has a full forehead... and clear eyes on a well-balanced face. Lung, you're early today. —This is for you... —Abalone! —Thank you, Lung. —I won at horse betting. This is for you. Thank you! —This is for you. —Thank you, Lung. Thank you, Lung! —You too! —Hey, Lung! —Thank you! —Hope you win again! Tell him it's true. He's really helpful. He does the dishes after dinner. He's really a good boy. He really does a good job. Sure he does. He breaks the dishes. —Go away, you witch! —Mind your own business. It's just occasionally. He only breaks things occasionally. You can tell him to sweep it up. And he can give you a massage. Let him massage you after work. He's really good! I rarely have dinner at home and I don't need a dishwasher or a masseur. How am I going to take care of him? I'm a woman. You know, he's so... Except for his brain, his body is fully developed. I'm a single and old woman. How am I supposed to take care of him alone? You're finally admitting that you're old and single. I'm just facing the truth at this critical juncture in my life. Look, we've been partners for over twenty years. What kind of best friend are you? And you too! We're trying to figure out how to help you now. He's right. If we don't care about you, we wouldn't be here trying to help you. —Ah Gou! —What's up? —I'm going to work now. —We have things to discuss with you. What's this? Are you singing a cappella? Are you trying to form a choir? —No. —There's no need to discuss. Let me give you a piece of advice. Find Iron Pen. I, Iron Pen, have worked here for decades. I'm famous for my accuracy in fortune-telling. Stop playing... A face reading tells you your luck. Fate affects your entire life. You can't have just a face reading. You must check your fate too. —Look, I'm offering... —How could you be accurate? You're using an idiot as your example? He's a retard... This foreigner said I was good. See? What's the matter with your big mouth? Folks, he has a face that's blessed with good luck. It's not his fault. It's his mother's fault. His mother did sinful things in her previous life. So it's not his fault. —It's really a lucky face. —Are you talking about my mum? Yes. She's over there. —Over there? —Hey! Your father must have done sinful things in his previous life. What a dirty mouth you've got. Do you want his autograph? Be quick. He'll be the next president. Don't patronise his store. He's not accurate. —Go to Auntie Ling's store... —Next time, okay? Don't patronise his store. —Men Men! —Fai. —Are you working? —Yes. Your mother scolded you again? No, she scolded Uncle Ying. Ying is taking advantage of you. Don't help him next time. —No, I'm looking for Siu Beng. —Where is he? Uncle Ying didn't say. Hey, give these to him when you see him. They're new arrivals. He'll like them. —Start working and stop talking. —Remember it. I have to go now. I don't understand why you like to hang out with a retard. Be careful. He might make you dumb too. Hanging out with you didn't turn me into a gambler. You dare to make fun of your brother? Hey, what are you doing? Let's get to work! Stop playing around. Hey... You can't just leave like this. You hurt his feelings. You broke his little heart. So what do you want me to do? I want to get married. His name is Phillip. He's a Chinese guy born in Hawaii. He said he fell in love with me at first sight. He wants me but doesn't want my son. What are you going to do with Fai then? That's the problem. I want you to look after him for the time being. I'll pay for his expenses. Just let him stay at your place. Please help me to look after him, all right? Hey, you can't leave like this. Are you really leaving me in the lurch? My son is already giving me enough trouble. And now your son, Fai... One is dumb. The other is rebellious. What kind of sinful things have I done in my previous life? What did I ever do to you? Why are you doing this to me? Have you forgotten? You wanted me to be your girlfriend when we were young. You said you wanted to marry me. And now you won't even help me? Luckily, I didn't marry you. If I did, my Ah Beng would be a retard instead of your Ah Fai. You lowlife! How dare you! Is it good? —It's so nice! —Really? I think this pair is good too. What do you think? It's really nice! All of them are nice! Which pair should I get? Sir, which pair do you want? I'm still deciding. Please hold on. Which pair should I get? Get this one for your right foot and the other one for your left foot. They would look really good! Moron... You're smart. Who taught you this? I'm planning to do so. Thank you. I've decided. This one for the left and that one for the right. Sir, that's not possible. What will I do with the rest? I don't care. Eat them if you want. I'll pay for these two. I'm paying for a pair of shoes. It's so simple. Are you a moron? —Is this okay? —Okay. It's raining. Use this plastic bag. —Try this. —Try what? Throw them away. —What are you doing? —You told me to throw them away. I told you to throw yours away. Don't be stupid. They're nice. I won't throw them away. That pair can really make him run faster. Siu Beng! You're really running faster with that pair of shoes! Siu Beng. It's raining. It's raining! Sis, you know me. You know me well. I wouldn't bother you if it wasn't an emergency. And this is really an emergency. I believe in fate. But I don't want to just give up. It's a great opportunity. It may be my last opportunity. Please tell me. Should I go to Hawaii with Phillip? Or should I stay here with Fai? I don't know what to do. Please make a decision for me. Please make a decision for me. I'll do what you choose. Hey, son, this is a temple. Don't move around here. Kneel down properly. Bow three times. Be more sincere. Sis, please. Make a decision for me. I'll go to Hawaii if only one is upside down. Please help me. Give me some advice. One is upside down? Honey. —Phillip. —Why do you need to pray? Can't you feel how true my love is? Yes... No, I'm just confused. Have some confidence in me and also in yourself. Don't worry. Let's go to Hawaii first. We can apply for Fai to go there after we've settled down. But... someone has to look after him while I'm gone. I'm worried about him... He's missing again. He's always doing this to me. Fai is twenty-seven years old. Give him some freedom. He'll learn to take care of himself. Otherwise, he will never grow up. Okay? Don't think so much. Retire after a few more shows. Then come to Hawaii with me. I came up with an English name for you. —It's Millie. —Mi... Can you say it again? Millie is similar to your Chinese name, Miu Leng. Don't disrupt my business! Uncle Bird will give me five dollars if I reserve this table for him. Fine. If you don't go, we'll tickle you! Go ahead. I'm not afraid of tickling. —You're really not leaving? —I'm not leaving. Let's play our game on him then. One, two, three, four, five. Eat you! It hurts! Don't push so hard. I have to pee. No, it's the middle of the game. I can't hold it in anymore! —We won't let you go. —No! Help! Fai, I'm coming to help you! Men Men, help me! You're so useless! —What? —You let them bully you. I pretended to let them bully me. What? You wouldn't have got away if I didn't help you like a hero. You're not a hero. —I'm a hero today. —Fai. You're late! You're two hours late, Uncle Bird! Smart kid... —I'll pay you ten dollars today. —How much change should I give you? —Keep the change... —Really? I'm rich! —Men Men, I'll treat you to a burger. —That's a lot of money. Hey, let's start the game. —Fai, are you waiting for Siu Beng? —Yes. Did you give him the stuff? I forgot about it. I've been so busy lately. You're bad. How could you forget such an important thing? I'll give it to him when I see him later. —Keep your promise. —Sure. —Men Men. —What? Look! I bought you the magic wand from Sailor Moon. —Magic wand from Sailor Moon? —Just chant, "Change, change, change!" —Change, change, change! —No, you must take your clothes off first. What? Take my clothes off? —I saw it on Siu Beng's tape. —Siu Beng... What tape? I watched your Sailor Moon tape. So I bought her a magic wand. I gave you money to buy food, not to buy a magic wand. What are you doing? Are you trying to date her? So you paid for it? I really like it. Thank you. You don't look like a fairy, even with a magic wand. I heard that your brother wants you to work at Chung's. But don't do it. Okay, I won't. Yes, they pay really poorly. Don't worry. I won't. Have you been busy lately? I haven't seen you for a while. Yes. Fai, come with me. I'm going to take you somewhere. —Where? I want to come too. —Where are you going? Get to work. —Maybe next time. —Hey, how about... —Let's go. —Goodbye, Men Men. Change, change, change! Siu Beng will turn around and look at me. Don't be silly. That kid won't like you. —Mind your own business. —Just start working. Three, four. Six, seven, take a breath. Turn and go down. One, two, three, four, five. Forward and back. One, two, three, four. Two, two, three, four. Three, two, three, four. Four, two, three, four, turn. Two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Two, two, three, four. Three, two, three, four. —Do you know her? —Reiterate, hold. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. —Hello. —Hello. Are you not leaving yet? —Are you going home? —What's up? It's nothing special. I'm just asking. What are you doing here? I want to dance. Good. Fai! Come out... —You knocked into her. —Come out first... Hey, what are you two doing here? —Teacher. —I'm sorry. You're the troublemaker, not him. Yes. You're the troublemaker, not him. Let's go. I'm sorry, Teacher. I'm so sorry. I have something to tell you. It's time to work. They are calling you. We're one person short tonight. —It's me again? —Let's go. I'm so sleepy. When can we leave? Siu Beng. What's that girl's name? Judy. —Judy is pretty. —Of course. She's a good dancer too. I want to dance with her. Are you here to work? Stop talking. Start working. It's show time. Go get ready. Go... You can stop shaking that. Shake. —Shake. —Fai. I really don't want to work here anymore. Why? Don't you think we're disconnected from society? Others are partying now. And I'm pretending to be a deity here. What do you want to do then? My dream. I want to be like Aaron Kwok. I want to hold a concert. —It's show time, Aaron Kwok. —Coming. He's truly talented. When can I dance as well as him? That depends on your talent. Siu Beng, you're amazing. What are you doing? —I'm the foot of Bruce Lee! —Don't do this! I'm sorry. Their father just died. Do you want to get beaten by them? —Be good and sit here. —It's boring here... We're going to leave soon... Siu Beng, you're a really good dancer. —Really? —Really. So what? It's not a concert. Fai, are you snuggling with your mother again? Mum, you're holding me too tightly. What's wrong? It's nothing special... I just want to cuddle with you for a little longer. Let me hold you a little longer too. Mum, you're great. Hey, Miu Leng, let us propose a toast to you. Have a safe trip! Thank you very much... —Have a drink! —Thank you. Thank you, everybody. —Don't come back so soon. —Be a good boy. She's marrying a nice guy. Men Men. Auntie Leng, Uncle Man. Hello. Auntie Tong. —Hello. —Auntie Tong. You should know her. The place she sang at closed down. So she's selling pirated CDs now. Try to help her if you can. I'll do whatever I can. —Count on me. —Thank you... Yes, don't worry... She's a good girl. This place is suitable for you. At least you can stand and sing here. If you work for Chung, you might have to sing in bed. And please take care of Fai for me when you're free. —Miu. —Ying, you're here. Your first boyfriend is here, Miu Leng. —Are you jealous? —No, I'm not. He's coming. Introduce us. I listened to your CDs. They're not that great. Really? I'll get you better ones next time. Okay. You've been wearing new clothes. Who are you trying to impress? Do you expect me to wear my priest robe instead? I want to learn dancing. Can you take me there next time? Dancing is not suitable for you. —What? No girls learn dancing? —There are. You're dating a girl? Come on, chew. So I'm right. What are you talking about? What's so good about her? She has nothing to do with you. Yes, I fell in love with a girl. She's nice and talented. She doesn't know what you do. I bet you didn't tell her. Of course I didn't. I fell in love with her before I get to talk to her. Relationships are about feelings. My dad never talked to me about this in my whole life. Yet, you always give me that face and ask so many questions. Have you tried to understand me? —Do you know what I'm thinking? —Yes, I do. You want to win in the dance competition and find a girl with a nice figure. The first part is correct. Hey... I'm going to the toilet. I wrote a new love poem. May I share it with you? Give me a second. You're indeed like a pineapple. I can't find it. Stop throwing them at me. —You're wasting them. —Miu. It's my fault. We shouldn't have fought. —Please don't blame me. —No, it's not your fault. It's my fault. I crossed the line. I'll drink this to show my sincerity. —Actually, I want to... —It's fine... —I understand. —What? It's fine. Just take care of him when you're free. Miu Leng, why don't you sing us a song before you leave? Yes, you have to do it. —Do I really have to sing? —Of course. Come on. Quick... Applause, please. Everybody, old friends and new friends, Miu will retire after singing tonight. She's getting married. Let's wish her a bright future. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Take care. We should remember tonight. We have to say goodbye in the morning. Let's treasure this moment. We'll meet each other again in the future. Don't forget to send letters to me! Don't be lazy! We will just call you. We can fax you! It's raining in our garden. The swallows are returning for autumn. Please take good care of yourself. We'll meet again someday. Good, we'll wait for you! Don't forget about us, Miu. Don't worry, Miu. We'll wait for you to come back. When I think of my son... My tears... Miu. Don't worry. I promise I'll take care of Fai. He's as tall as me now. I'll treat him as my son. I'll do my best to raise him. Thank you for your help again. Thanks to you, I feel relieved. You're in my prayers. I hope you have a good life. Don't say that, sweetie. Life is like a drama. There's always something going on. I'm affectionate and you're righteous. You're passionate and I'm logical. It's lucky that I met you. It's better than a movie. Life is like a drama. There's always something going on. I'm affectionate and you're righteous. You're passionate and I'm logical. It's lucky that I met you. It's better than a movie. Everyone is going somewhere. The place there is beautiful. Everyone is going somewhere. They are dancing... all night long. The place there is beautiful. It is beautiful and shining. Dad. Dad. Okay, I'll deal with him. It's early in the morning. What are you doing? You can't shower like this! Hey, stop... Take off those wet clothes. You'll get a cold. You're naughty! What are you doing? What's happening here? Don't beat him... You little brat! Don't beat him... Stop...! Fai! They say Dettol is the best. The man in the commercial said you had to dry your body, right? People must take care of themselves, right? Have you heard of it before? That's right. You'll be good looking after you dry your body. People must take care of themselves, right? —What will happen if you dry your body? —You'll be more beautiful. —And more attractive. —You remember that? Clean up and you'll be more beautiful. How's your stomach? —It's fine. —Nice. —I have to leave now then. —Where are you going? There. —There? —Yes. I'm leaving now. Watch what you say, guys. Don't irritate him. —Goodbye. —Goodbye. Have a bun. Take the money, Fai. Be good. Don't spend your money on food all at once. —Why are you giving me money? —Take this. Don't give it to anyone no matter what. Don't spoil him. It will bring trouble. Rather than give him money, you should give me some instead. Just sleep if you're sleepy. Fai. —Have some buns. —More buns? Yes. —Eat some more. —Thank you, Auntie. I'll give you some money. Be a good boy. Be careful with it. You're giving me buns and money. It's better than doing business. You have to smarten up now that your mother has dumped you. Hey! What are you talking about? I'm telling the truth. I feel sorry for him. You feel sorry for him? —You'd better shut up. —His mother... —His mother left him for a guy. —Just leave. Just shut up and leave. You should feel pity for me instead. Have some tea... Have some buns... What's wrong? You're always excited to see me normally. I'm in trouble. My mum is missing. No one is going to take care of me. You're grown up. You can take care of yourself. My mum didn't take care of me too. But you have an elder brother. Hey, come on. I'll be your elder sister and play with you. —What do we play? —We shall play... Let's play a hero saving his sister... No, saving a beauty. Hero saving a beauty? I played it with Siu Beng before. It wasn't fun. It's different. You're a hero now. And you're going to save your sister. Siu Beng is not your sister. It's more fun to play with me. Fine. Auntie. Can Peter pretend to be the bad guy? No. I'm sorry. —How could you do that? —What? We don't need a bad guy. —I'm caught by the tree monster. —Tree monster? It wasn't the tree monster last time. Help! Help me! I'm the Masked Rider! Who's hurting this young lady? Help! Help me! It has caught me. —Why would it catch you? —It's because it wants to rape me! —Rape! Help! —It wants to rape you? We don't play rape. You're so naughty. Stop talking and just save me! Help! I can't breathe! —Watch out! It's poisonous. —Don't worry, I'll cut it down. —Let go of her! —It's grabbing my hands! Hit it! It's going to attack! It sounds good. Why have you transformed into another person, Men Men? Do you know it's a crime to destroy trees? You're the tree monster. —He didn't mean it. —She's the tree monster. She's a police officer! She'll arrest you! Police? That's great, my mum has gone missing. —I want to make a police report! —Sorry, just ignore him. My mum has gone missing! It's really funny. —What game should we play next? —Do you have any ideas? I'll take you to see Siu Beng's dance rehearsal. No. —Come on. —No, he's mean. He won't like it. Hey. You get pineapple if you sow pineapple. You won't get any pineapple if you sow mango. Do you want pineapple or mango? Banana! I don't want to go. You're the one forcing me to go. Sorry, I thought no one was here. Am I disturbing you? Can I come in? No, you aren't disturbing me. Don't bother about me. I just came here for practice. Can you do me a favour? I'm going to an audition for a musical drama. Can you be my partner and dance with me? Why me? Is that a yes or no? Amazing! Siu Beng, your dancing is great. You're awesome, except for your pants. —Let's rest and do it again later. —Okay. Judy. —Where did you buy this top? —Why are you here? You dance really well. This is where you practise? It's a rehearsal room. It's really hot inside. I'm really afraid of the heat. It's not suitable for me. I'm leaving now. Goodbye, Men Men. —Men Men. —Siu Beng, time to start work. What's up? Cover my job. Take a taxi and cover my job. —Me? —Yes, you can do it. —No. Uncle Gou will scold me. —No, he won't. Tell him I said so. —You said I could. —Yes, do me a favour. Okay, I will. —Be good and sit here. —I have a question. What are they talking about? They are arguing over the inheritance. Shame on them. I know that guy. He's Goldmine Wong. Rich men are like that. They'd be happy if they were like you. Don't bother about them. Get your work done first. We have another one to go. Watch over him. It's not up for discussion. All of you, shut up! I'm the eldest, the eldest son in this family. I'm entitled to everything. You don't need to cry. Shut up. She hated you. And the two of you, you took her jewellery. You'd better give them back. He's talking to you. —What? —What? He said you took Mum's jewellery and money. You'd better give them back. Mum... Mum, I'm innocent. I don't want to live anymore. They all gang up and bully your youngest daughter. I told you to make a will. Brothers, sisters, everyone, just shut up. Mum said all her money and property would be mine. I have uncles and aunties as my witnesses. Really? Aren't you deaf? Did you hear what Mum said? I wasn't deaf at that time. Stop pretending. He's talking about you. —You're still pretending to be deaf? —How dare you hit me? Yes, I did, so what? Don't expect to get anything from me. Why did you hit me? It's impossible! You'd better leave! Get out of here if you don't shut up! Please go back to your seats. Sir, please get the job done quickly... Siu Beng is not here yet. Who's going to do it? Who? Me. —You? —Yes, Siu Beng told me to do so. You know how to do it? Yes. What is he doing? Is he trying to ruin the ritual? Who let this guy conduct the ritual for my mum? —How could you do that? —What's wrong with you? What kind of mum are you? You left your son like this. Why would you do such a thing? Sorry, son. I didn't want to. Please forgive me. I'm not going to forgive you. —Come and have dinner. —No. I'm angry at you. What's up now? Are you playing voice-over again? What's on this episode? —A son scolding his mother. —Just in time. I'm starving. You're eating like a dog. What did you do last night? I worked and went to a dance rehearsal. Dance rehearsal? That's why you didn't come home? And you got this retard to do your job for you. You've ruined your job. I told you to sit there, not to do the job. You're the one who's dumb, neglecting your job for a girl. Your reputation is ruined. How are you going to work? What has that girl done to you? She made you like this? What have you told my dad? You're blaming her? Don't you feel ashamed of yourself? You've ruined the name of the whole business. —You neglected your work for a girl. —That's enough, Dad. I know I was wrong. But I'm not a criminal. —You forced me into this business. —Why did you take the job then? Did I have a choice? Do you think I like to dance at a funeral? It's a lifetime job. Whether you understand it or not, I'm going to be myself. I'm done. Take your time. Siu Beng. Siu Beng. Are you angry at me? Are you angry at me? —Are you... —Don't ask. It's my fault, okay? Did you sleep with her? I take that as a yes. Fine. What's fine? Men Men! Don't fight. Let me take the magic wand out. Come to your senses, will you! She's a rich kid who can afford to learn dancing as a hobby. What about us? We barely make a living. Don't forget we both grew up in Temple Street. I'm starting to feel the distance between us. At least I'm proud of myself. I tried to achieve something. Did you try to achieve anything Look at you! Your only dream is for us to sell pirated CDs together. —Siu Beng. —It's true. Do you know why you like me? You like me because you've given up. You said people wouldn't change. You want me to stay in Temple Street with you forever. But I can't. How dare you, Siu Beng! Men Men. It's the magic wand. —The magic wand! —Fai! Fai, please wake up... —Don't die, Fai. —Fai... It can't end like this. What should I tell his mother, Miu Leng? Don't worry. He's going to be fine. Shut up. It's not even up to you. You said his face brought luck. You said that. If he really doesn't make it, it means you're a swindler. How can you be a fortune teller? —What are you talking about? —Am I not right? I talked about his fortune, not destiny. I didn't foresee that. I can't fight destiny, no matter how good I am. Stop arguing. You two should be watching out for him. How could you let him fall from a rooftop? What happened? Doctor. Doctor. How's Fai? Now you know why doctors always put on the same expression. It's a nervous moment for the family now. We have to be careful with our facial expressions. What does that mean? Are you mentally prepared? —Fai, he... —He has passed the critical period. —It's great. —Yes. That's great. You're so funny, Doctor. You scared me to death. He had a brain concussion. We have already operated on him. We found a tumour in his head. Maybe the tumour made him mentally challenged. We've removed the tumour now. Will he become normal? Become normal? That will require observation. I'm sorry. You did nothing wrong. You spoke the truth. My life is about selling pirated CDs. I'll not go far in life. The person I used to love is no longer worth my attention anymore. I wish you luck. I hope you can become famous. Maybe I'll get the chance to sell your pirated CDs. So this is the thing in my head. No wonder I always get headaches. It's lucky I've got rid of you now. Nobody will call you an idiot anymore. Does that mean I'm a genius now? Of course! It's lucky that you're still alive! Forget about being a genius! Are you feeling better now? There's still a little bit of pain. Do a little bit of walking later. It will do you good. —Get up and take your medicine. —Okay. What's wrong? When you go out of the door later, keep to the right. —What's the matter? —There will be an air crash! He's a genius? Why is he still acting like an idiot? He's recovering. It's quite normal. What would happen if you were him? What would happen if you were me? I'm not as stupid as you are. I've already told her. There would be an air crash. It's been a long time since I read a comic book! Hello, idiot! It's been so long... —Where have you been? —What idiot? Your father is an idiot! You'd better put those dirty books away or you'll get sued. Now you know how to make fun of others. Let me give you a test. If you guess right, this will be yours. Let me give you a riddle. What has no fingers, but many rings? This question is so simple! —Goodbye! —What's the answer? Isn't it a tree? Let me give you a riddle instead. Which body part can be touched by your papa and your mama... your elder brother but not your sister. Your younger brother but not your cousin? If you know the answer, I'll return the money to you. Goodbye. This question is so complicated! Uncle Hum, Auntie Fe, how are you? Good morning, Idiot Fai! I heard that your brain tumour was removed. —Idiot Fai is dead! —What? —Are you really dead? —No, I've become Genius Fai! Here's a hundred dollars for you to buy something to eat. I've become Genius Fai! Didn't you know that? I think he's getting worse! The house is falling apart! The house is falling down! It's falling! It's falling! Watch out! Auntie Lok...! It's dangerous! Auntie Lok, are you all right? —I'm fine! Thank you for your help! —It's all right. Don't mention it! —He can foresee the future. —We will be rich soon! Are you going to faint? Where's the newspaper boy? Papa can touch it, Mama can touch it... You're still here? Are you all right? Don't touch me there! It hurts! Are you still thinking about that question? What's the answer? The body part is your lips. Your lips touch when you say "Papa" and "Mama." And "brother" but not when you say "sister." You can't touch this either! —I think it's time to change your name. —Why? —To get famous of course! —Get famous? —You should be called Prophet Fai! —Why so? Let me teach you feng shui and palm and face reading. You'll definitely become famous! Ladies and gentlemen, please come closer! Don't block the road! Stand closer. Hey, fat gentleman, please don't block the road! —I've waited for very long! —It will be your turn soon! Please stand closer! Please stand closer! Hey lady, don't be afraid. You've got a very fat son, right? Yes... Does he like cycling? Yes... You'd better watch out for him then. He might have an accident, especially on the left leg. Your first man is not your present husband, right? —Lady, don't be sad. —Yes... Prophet, how is it? Are you here to test my skill? Your father is dead and you've inherited his fortune. Yet, you're still asking questions regarding your father? —You're really good. —Hey. —Don't mess around with teen girls. —Yes, I know... You're really good! —How is he? —He's really accurate! Thank you very much! —Next one, please! —Please take a look at me. Prophet... Please see if he has another woman. —He's your husband? —His name is Gou. Prophet, please be careful of what you say. My life is in your hands now. Keep quiet! Don't make a sound! Does he have another woman on the side? No. Thank you, Prophet! —Thank you, Prophet! —Please get up... Do you know that you're famous now? A bit, I guess. The folks here know me. Is that why they call it a special talent? I don't think so. I still have to reach out and touch them... This guy is very familiar. Where have I seen him before? David, let's get this guy to forecast real estate. We will be rich! If that's so, we must hurry! Others will think of the same thing! I know who he is! He conducted the ritual at my mum's funeral. We'll be rich! We'll be rich! Mr Fai! Mr Lau! This way... Mr Fai, good day! They're the best sales agents in the Hong Kong real estate. There are six of them. Today, we sincerely invite Mr Fai... to teach us something regarding real estate. You want me to teach you something? We want Mr Fai to give us predictions on which area to invest in. If the predictions are correct, I won't give both of you a hard time. I don't understand what you mean. Can you be more precise? You can invest in my Goldmine Group... and we'll get rich together! How does that sound? He's not a good guy. You'd better be careful. Don't worry. Are you responsible for the southern area? Yes... I can see the Jumbo Seafood Boat. Don't drink too much Pu-erh tea. It is bad for your digestion. —Are you staying in Gon Tong? —Yes. —Can you reach home in five minutes? —Yes. Your wife is fooling around at home. You can catch her in the act! You can change your profession now. You don't believe me? Why are you back? I don't care about her, as long as I can make money! You're smart! That's why you're a real estate star! Let's give him a round of applause! She's the one! She's surrounded by holy light! She will be the best! Isn't she the one who is in charge of Lantau Island? Do we really invest in a rural area? You don't believe me? Of course I believe you! —We believe! —We believe! —Mr Fai is good! —Long live Mr Fai! Mr Fai is good! Long live Mr Fai! —Everybody will be rich! —Long live Mr Fai! Long live Mr Fai! Let's drink! Come on, Mr Fai! Let's drink! How many funerals are we going tonight? Three. We're short of help. —Are you leaving? —Yes, we're leaving. Goodbye! —Goodbye! —Goodbye! —What are you doing? —I'm packing. There's a seaside bungalow owned by the Goldmine Company. They said I could stay there, so I'm moving there. Do you know why they treat you so well? Yes! They're making use of me. Do you think I'm stupid? Don't worry. I'm smarter than he is. I won't be taken in. Don't you think everything comes too fast? Fai, you've changed a lot. Isn't that good? Would you prefer me to remain a retard like before? When you get the chance, surely you'll go for it, right? You don't like the way I am now? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Fai. Why didn't you tell me you've joined the Goldmine Group? If you behave like this, you won't get to enjoy your fortune in the future. Uncle Ying, I'm not a child anymore. I can make my own decisions. Besides, all they want is me, not you. Don't get mad. —Listen to me. —No, you listen to me. —You listen to me. —No, you listen to me. —You listen to me! —You listen to me first! Okay! You first! Telling fortune outside is tough and even we youngsters can't take it. Why don't you go back to your stall and live an easy life? When I get rich, I promise I'll share it with you. I've got a pair of new shoes. Aren't they shiny? —Judy, have you seen Ah Fai? —No. He promised to look for me, but there's still no sight of him! Relax, just take it easy! Have some confidence. You'll make it. Judy! It's been a long time. Are you still dancing? I thought I might see you here. —And it turned out... —Let me introduce. This is my partner, Siu Beng. And this is Eddie Mok, the director and producer of this play. —Hello! —Hello! It's good to know... that you're still dancing. Don't worry, I won't give up dancing because of you. I'm relieved then. Eddie! Time's up! Go and standby. Don't block the others. I'm going out now. See you later. Do your best! Do your best! —Is that your former boyfriend? —Yes. That woman is his wife and my former good friend. What else do you wish to know? —Numbers one to fifteen, please stand by. —It's our turn. Let's get ready. Siu Beng, you're here! —You're late! —My timing is just right. Is it your turn now? —Almost. —Yes... how are you? —I'll let you guys talk. —All right. —I'll look for you later. —Why is she always so hostile? She's just nervous. How do I look today? You're terrific! I'll share a secret with you, but don't tell the others. I'm very nervous! If I can't make it this time, —I'm doomed! —Don't be nervous. Calm down, take a deep breath and close your eyes. Calm down... Close your eyes and take a breath slowly. Siu Beng, I know you can make it! Do your very best! You can make it! It's your turn now. What is it? —What is it? —Can I make it? You can make it if you try your best. Tell me if I can make it! Don't tell me I can't make it. I can't lose... —It has nothing to do with you. —What do you mean by that? —Just do your best! —Help me! —Help me! —Go now and do your best! —I'll try my best! —It's not your fault! What do you mean it's not my fault? I'll do my best... I can do it... Fai, I'll prove to you that I can make it. You don't want to help me? I'll do it myself. I can make it... I don't believe you... It's our turn now? What's wrong? Are you all right? We can make it! It's your ex-girlfriend's turn. What ex-girlfriend? Tell them to start now. Both of you can start now. —She's not that good. —She's not bad. Of course you'll praise her. You're praising her because you still have feelings for her, right? Some of her steps are clumsy. Don't speak so loudly. I just don't understand. I know, she's getting fatter. Just look at her. She's fat now. Look, her legs are fat now. And her tummy too. Even her face is getting fatter. It's big and round like a bun... What's wrong? Can't I comment on her? Is her dance partner her boyfriend? Not bad, he's tall and strong. —But he looks like a village boy. —Just watch carefully. Look, they're holding hands. They have chemistry. You aren't jealous, are you? Why don't you speak up? I'm asking you a question. —Have you said enough? —Okay. They've given up. They're disqualified. She has improved a lot... but I don't understand why she gave up just like that. The couple we chose is not bad either. The boy was interesting. I still can't stop laughing! —What's wrong with you? —Why must you always take from me! —Judy, stop fighting! —What are you doing? —Stop fighting, Judy! —Go away! —Slut! —Judy! It's over between us! It's already over on the stage just now! Fai...! —Help me, Fai! Help me! —What? —Help me! —Help you with what? Help me to change the ending! Calm down! I can see the future, but I can't change it! Help me for the last time! I've never asked you for help. Calm down, I can't help you. Am I not handsome anymore? No, you danced really well. You really did! Don't be like this. Siu Beng... You've changed. You've changed. Siu Beng... You must be hiding there. Is that right? Everyone has changed... Why? Why didn't I change? Change...! Change... why didn't I change? Change! Number twenty-five! Miu Leng! —Miu! Miu! —I'm back! —When did you come back? —Now! —Pang Di is inside! —Really? Pang Di... —Miu is back! —Miu! Why did you come back? I came back to visit old friends. But you said before that you'd return in glory... Do I look that poor now? —Yes! —Yes! Phillip is dead. —How did he die? —How did he die? He died of a heart attack in the bed. —How much money did he leave you? —There wasn't any. Even if there was, he would have left it to his wife and sons. Until his death, we were still not registered. How is Fai now? My son... My son... What? Why is he wanted by the police? Look carefully. Your son has changed from an idiot to Superman now! Believe in me and your own choice. You're on the right path! Welcome to this Premonition General Assembly! First of all, don't think that you're stupid to come here... by paying such a high price and yet you can't learn anything. You're here now. What's the purpose of coming here? It's to learn how to use your aura to communicate better with others. That's why we have this Aura Bracelet to benefit all of you. Fai! It's me! Or you can call it a Premonition Bracelet too. An Aura Bracelet and a Premonition Bracelet are the same. The benefit of wearing this is to strengthen your aura. Next time, you can become a prophet too! Everyone can become like me! Idiot, why are you still thinking about your mother? Your mother abandoned you! Idiot... No wonder your mother abandoned you! Your mother abandoned you instead! With this bracelet, we'll be prophets for life? Prophet? We'll be a prophet just like you for life? Yes, it should be! It depends on your sincerity too. Now I'm going to introduce the Fate-Changing Comb. In order for you to strengthen your aura with this comb... you have to remember a chant. You must say the following words whenever you comb your hair. Comb left and right, in and out and luck will come to you! Everyone, follow me! Comb left and right, in and out... and luck will come to you! Fai! Hey, lady, will you be quiet? I'm teaching a chant. What? I'm your mother (Ni Ah Ma)! Madam Ni Ah Ma? Will you be quiet for a while? We'll discuss this in private later. Sit down first and don't disturb us. All right, let's continue our chant! Stand up, everyone! Imagine you're holding your comb... and let's practise the chant. Get ready, one, two, three. Comb to the left and right, in and out... and luck will come to you! Let's do it again! Comb to the left and right, in and out and luck will come to you! Okay! Let's do it once more! I've introduced a lot of things... and you've read a lot of my books, so choose whatever you want. You must listen to what the prophet said. Lady, if you buy five items, I'll give you one free. Buy five, get one free! Hurry! —There are not many left! —Please make way... Come and choose quickly! This bracelet suits you! Fai. I'm your mother. If you wish to purchase anything, go there and line up. I'm not just some lady. I'm your mother! You've become so brilliant, yet you can't remember your own mum? What's the matter with you? Are you playing games with me? May I ask how long you have not met your son? I heard that your son is a retard, right? Any mother who abandons a poor retarded son... must be a lousy mother. Are you all right, Fai? David. Can we slow down a bit? I'm exhausted. But so many people like you! Don't you like money? If you're tired, eat vitamins and get some rest. You'll be fine. Welcome, Mr Fai. Please be seated. Get some tea for Mr Fai. —It's my first time here. —Really? I'm very familiar with this place. The singer up there is my mother. Really? What a lousy singer! This singer is really bad! Go home! What are you looking at? I said she was a lousy singer. Can't she listen? Go home! Come here... Here's a thousand dollar tip for her. —Thank you. —Thank you. Tell her to step down. Tell Miu Leng to get down from the stage. Take this money to her. I got it, Gam Hong. Thank you for the tip, Mr Fai. It doesn't matter. As long as Mr Fai is happy, I'll come down. I'll sing! Sorry, everybody! Please forgive us! Please forgive us! Let's continue. My Lord, would you like to walk in the garden? Your humble servant will walk with you. If you write a poem, your humble servant will too. You must be very happy now. This is a very good poem. You'd recited the poems very naturally. When we hum the verses together, it is just like snowing in the summer. My singing is not as good as yours. But the scenery is really beautiful. You'll fall in love with it. Go and check who is the owner of this place. How could you treat your mother like that? I wouldn't do that to my mother if she was still alive. Why don't you ask my mother how she treated me? Do you remember you used to come here and play? —I don't remember. —You don't remember? Why do you hate Auntie Leng so much then? Think about it. If a mother cruelly abandoned her idiot child... would you consider her a good person? She loves you very much. You asked me here just to talk about her? Fai, I would like to ask you. Do you like the past Fai or the present Fai? How am I supposed to answer your question? They are both me. Are you happier now or were you happier in the past? —Now. —Come with me. You used to like to hide here. You were happy playing here alone. You brought us so much laughter with your poems. You don't remember that either? Look around. It was clean in the past... and the three of us used to play over there. And you liked to put people's underwear on top of your head. You still don't remember? Come over here! Come over here! Look down! You fell down from here! You still don't remember? If it takes a fall for you to go back to the past, I'll push you down again! What do you want from me? What do you want me to reminisce? I have everything I want now! What's so bad about that? You've lost all your emotions and feelings! Those are the things I long for! I was an orphan. There are three important men in my life, my brother, Siu Beng and you. But I didn't expect you to disappoint me the most! Doctor, I don't have any family. You can tell it to me straight. Removing the brain tumour brought about a very positive effect. It made your IQ abnormally high. But the situation will gradually reverse itself. It's because there are still some destructive brain cells in your brain. Let me explain to you in simpler terms. Can you tell me in the most direct way what is happening? Your IQ will continue to drop... and your memory will keep on deteriorating. Keep on deteriorating? Are you telling me that I'll become an idiot again? Yes, in another six months. Why should I believe you? Why would I lie to you? Let's call it a day. Goodbye, Doctor. How do you feel about fortune-telling? To tell the truth... You look like someone. Who? He's an idiot who doesn't know how to play chess. —He doesn't know how to play chess? —He would speak very loudly! And he laughs so loudly! —He would laugh like a chicken! —So he laughs like a chicken? —Does he have family? —Yes! His mother is always looking for him. —Looking for him on the street? —Yes! He always calls himself the Masked Rider! He really thinks so. He must be crazy. And his hair always gets burnt. Really? It's your turn to play. —He's really miserable. —How would he be dressed? He would wear pyjamas, a vest and slippers... walking along the street. A guest is here. Please stop there. First bow! Second bow! Third bow! Family, return bow! Uncle Gou. Fai? What brings you here? I'm looking for Siu Beng. We don't know where he is either. It's easier for you to find him as you're a prophet now. This is his robe. You can try to locate him. Thank you, Uncle Gou. Mr Fai! Please give us some advice! —What advice? —Tell us how to get rich. Cherish the present. Your powers are so strong now. You can find me with my robe. What will come will come, what will be found will be found. Yes, what's yours is yours. What's not yours is not yours. Siu Beng. Are you still mad at me? —What? —How could I stay mad at you forever? That's true. Nothing lasts forever. Do you think we can still go and play together? Will you still go out with me? Tell me what happened to you. You're scaring me. —Nothing is wrong. —Tell me. —Nothing is wrong... —Tell me just the same, okay? Okay? The doctor told me that... I'll become an idiot again very soon. Do you think you'll treat me like a friend again? Don't disguise yourself like this again. I might not recognise you. You must let me find you. I'm so afraid... It's you again. Don't stand in front of our shop. We've got a business to run. I'm now giving you notice... Why are you standing so close to me? What's wrong? What's the matter? I don't know what they want. They're closing down the shop! We pay the rent every month. So what's wrong? Someone bought this place. You have to move out. Who bought this place? That is too outrageous! The Goldmine Group bought this place! Fai is behind this! Fai is trying to destroy all of us. Can you ask him to reconsider? We didn't offend him. How could he do such a thing to his own mother? This is not an auspicious spot. It's full of "yin" energy. Don't put any office table here. This year is good for staying south and facing north. No other direction is better than this! The magnetic field over there is the strongest. The best spot is right here! Hold on. All of you, come over here. All of you are masters, but you have so many suggestions! It's very difficult for us to decide. All we want to know is where the most suitable place is... for the chief executive's table. —This side... —That side... That direction is the best! —I don't think so... —Please be quiet... Be quiet! Where is Prophet Fai? Prophet Fai? Prophet Fai! He's here! Prophet Fai, what do you think? The Chief Executive's birth horoscope doesn't fit here. He likes to watch over the garden and look at the birds. His office should be over there... opposite the sea. Can't I see my son? What's the matter with you? Prophet Fai... I can even call you Lord Fai! I don't mind that you treat me badly. I deserve it. I was wrong to abandon you. I deserve it. But you don't have to use such despicable means to destroy all of us! What are you talking about? A lot of people depend on that opera stage. All of them depend on it for a living. How could you do this to them? —What are you talking about? —You don't understand? You sent someone to take over the shop! You told me to do so that night. You're just picking on me, right? Please let them off. I beg of you. I'll do whatever you say. Just let them off, okay? —I'll even kneel down before you! —Mum! Miu Leng! Don't do that! When he grows up, he'll be an idiot. Why don't you just throw him away? I can't do that! He's my son. When you get older and are with an idiot son, who will want you? You know he's my only son. How could I abandon him? Watch out! Let's go home... I'll hold you tight. Heaven's will is unpredictable and human life is impermanent. How did things turn out like this? My son will become an idiot again. Stop crying. He wouldn't like to see you cry. The patient has regained consciousness. You can go in. But go in pairs, okay? And lower your voices. Stick out your little finger... —What are you doing? —Come on. Stick out your little finger... Hook your little fingers and you'll be together from beginning to end! The two of you love each other and you'll have a happy ending. The two of you will get married, have a baby... and form a family! Where is my magic wand? I didn't bring it. The nurse said this was the magic wand. Who's that? —Remember, two by two! —Yes, we know. Who are you? I'm Miu Leng. —Do you need eye drops? —I don't need eye drops. I've got no more tears left. How do you feel? Do you feel hot? —I'm not hot at all. —Just look at your sweat. Even your body is sweating! I'll wipe it so that you won't get sick. Really? Mother is the best. Mother will always be pretty. Mother's eyes are watery. Her eyes are shining bright. Clean her eyes with some eye drops. And her eyes will become bright and shiny again... Fai likes that magic wand. Bring it for him next time. I threw it away. I don't need it anymore. You're right. —I'll never look like a fairy. —You're still mad at me? No, don't get me wrong. I've made up my mind. I'll never sell pirated CDs again. I've decided to learn Cantonese opera from Auntie Leng. The rest of the time, I'll take care of Fai. I want to prove to myself that I can be a talented woman. Just like what you told me, find yourself. Hey... Don't be like this. We are still good friends, right? I know. I know I'm not qualified to love someone. But I never thought that... I'd be the most useless person among the three of us. No matter what... please give me a chance to apologise. It's not necessary. All right, go ahead. —1437. —What? 1437! What's that? I don't understand. I... love... forever. Forever. Don't move about! Be good! Don't move! Don't move! If you look like a hippie, you'll never find a girlfriend! Son, come back and let me cut your hair. Don't you want to go and see the Chief Executive? Yes, so you have to cut your hair. Son! Come back! —Over here... —I'm coming! Miu Leng is coming! Where are you? Where are you going? I'm right here! What's wrong? —Nothing. —Peed on your pants again? —No. —Are you telling the truth? Let's go and change your pants.
