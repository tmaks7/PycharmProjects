Action! ﻿I’ve just got back, ﻿it was beautiful. ﻿A lovely cemetery ﻿the sea, ﻿such peace ﻿and quiet... ﻿Trees too. ﻿It suits him. ﻿He’ll be fine.. ﻿You’ll go when you’re up to it... ﻿ ﻿No, just twenty of us, ﻿those closest... ﻿Avery simple ceremony... ﻿they played Debussy. ﻿Everyone spoke about him... ﻿No, ﻿it’s not your fault. ﻿ ﻿No good? ﻿It's not okay? ﻿Not what you wanted? ﻿It’s not you.. ﻿Something’s not working. ﻿-	How many takes? -	That was the 15th. ﻿ ﻿No, it’s not that! ﻿Back in position! ﻿Shall we try again? ﻿Wasn’t I any good? ﻿ ﻿-You can tell me. -You were just fine. ﻿We'change nothing, then? ﻿I- I don't know. ﻿-Which mirror do we use? -The baroque. I told you! ﻿I can’t go on. Let’s take 5. ﻿Richard? Are you OK? ﻿I’m too hot... Suffocating... ﻿Take a break. It’ll help. ﻿The day’s nearly over. ﻿What’s wrong with the scene? ﻿It doesn’t work. ﻿Find out why. I know you will! ﻿Excuse me. ﻿When you’re ready. ﻿Can you take over? ﻿-I really need some air. -What? ﻿Can you shoot the scene? ﻿You sure? ﻿It’s a key scene, I don’t know if... ﻿I can’t go on. ﻿What’s all this? ﻿I can’t. Find someone else. ﻿What’re you saying? ﻿You chose wrongly. Simon will do a better job. ﻿You kidding? ﻿You’re just tired. I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that. ﻿I’m serious. ﻿You’re not, you’ve lost it. ﻿-What's left to do today? -Inserts. Patricia doesn’t have to stay. ﻿Can we do the scene tomorrow? ﻿Yes... I’ll make space for it. ﻿Perfect! ﻿We’ll do the scene tomorrow. ﻿Go home and rest. ﻿-Tomorrow won’t change anything! -Tomorrow’s another day! ﻿Take a break and Simon will finish today. ﻿Richard? ﻿You reckon? ﻿I’m the producer, I decide. ﻿Simon, I’m counting on you. ﻿No problem! ﻿Change of program everyone! ﻿Get going! See you tomorrow! ﻿- Good evening sir. - Good evening. ﻿What can I get you? ﻿-ZA whiskey please. -Awhiskey? Sure. ﻿Oh God. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Thank you. ﻿- Madame. - Thank you. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Thanks! ﻿Richard! ﻿Shit. ﻿Evening. ﻿You good? ﻿Yes, and you? ﻿-Yeah. -Great. ﻿We’re trying the new bar, Pink something... ﻿Mister Pink. ﻿Great name. ﻿Who cares? If it’s good. ﻿Want to join us? ﻿Are you kidding? ﻿ ﻿You off somewhere? ﻿Yes, I am. ﻿So, what’s new? ﻿Working on a new film? ﻿Yes. In the middle of a shoot. ﻿Brilliant! ﻿How’s it going? ﻿It’s going very well. ﻿Great news! ﻿Good. ﻿I must go. ﻿ ﻿Two minutes! ﻿It’s cool to see each other, eh? ﻿Not really. ﻿ ﻿Are you with someone else? ﻿Do you care? ﻿Have a good night. ﻿Hang on... Let me say goodbye! ﻿Yes? ﻿On our way ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Is the shoot going well? ﻿I’m under pressure. ﻿More than usual? ﻿Different this time. ﻿You OK? ﻿You look tired. ﻿Yes, but... ﻿Sometimes I wonder why I do it. ﻿We all do sometimes, eh? ﻿Perhaps. ﻿And you? ﻿You OK? ﻿Pretty good actually. ﻿I thought about you recently. ﻿Just got back from India! ﻿Brilliant! ﻿You liked it? ﻿Call me sometime, let’s talk about it... ﻿You can call me too, you know... ﻿Yes... But with Frederic, it’s not easy. ﻿Have you heard from Mathias? ﻿No, have you? ﻿-What were you talking about? -Mathias. ﻿He pissed everyone off, no one wants to see him! ﻿Don’t speak about him, please. ﻿I liked him. ﻿He was Richard’s best mate, not mine! ﻿Always round the flat... ﻿About the flat, I want my keys. ﻿What? Still on about that? ﻿I want them back. ﻿OK. If I find them. ﻿-Have you lost them? -No. ﻿I don’t give a fuck about them. ﻿-Of course... -Of course, what? ﻿..You don’t give a fuck. ﻿None of your dramas. ﻿Drama? ﻿-Always the same old shit. -What? ﻿Dramas, like in your films! ﻿-Don’t talk about my films! -Don’t worry, I won’t! ﻿Well, you’re an artist... ﻿And what are you? ﻿-Me? At least I’ve got a life! -But living off who, eh? ﻿You’re touchy because you’re single ﻿Now you’re really fucking me off! ﻿Stop it! ﻿Stop it! ﻿Fuck off! ﻿Cunt! ﻿Calm down! ﻿You OK? ﻿I can’t bear arguments. Can’t stand them. ﻿I’ve got an Uber coming. Drop you off? ﻿That’s kind. ﻿sorry. ﻿Here it is. ﻿Coming? ﻿I don’t know the background obviously, ﻿but you seemed in danger. ﻿Thank you. ﻿When I saw him, I... ﻿was everything to him. ﻿His nurse, his shrink, ﻿his cook. ﻿It was never enough. ﻿He bled me dry. ﻿Was it recent? ﻿Ended 5 months ago. ﻿It was like nothing had changed. ﻿Like going back in time. ﻿I once fought in the street with my ex. ﻿Nobody lifted a finger, ﻿luckily I got away. ﻿He gave up. ﻿He always found a reason to argue. ﻿It was always my fault. ﻿Finally, I had enough, ﻿I said I was leaving him. ﻿He lost it ﻿and tried to hit me. ﻿I got away ﻿and he followed me down the street. ﻿First time you’ve seen him since? ﻿ ﻿We ran into each other by chance. ﻿It’s still raw. ﻿Fighting doesn’t help. ﻿I need to turn over a new leaf. ﻿But I’m not succeeding. ﻿It took me a while too. ﻿What about changing the book? ﻿What? ﻿You know, new leaf, change the book... ﻿I find it hard to get rid of old books. ﻿Just drop me here. ﻿-Sorry, I wasn’t trying to... -No, no, it’s fine. ﻿Thank you. ﻿-Thank you very much. -You're welcome. ﻿Goodnight. ﻿It’s Maurice. You didn’t call. ﻿You must be home now. ﻿Have a drink and relax. We’re counting on you tomorrow. ﻿Simon noticed you’d left your script and notes. ﻿Just so you know. ﻿He’s got them. See you tomorrow! ﻿-Good evening. -Richard! Come in. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Sit down. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Let’s have a drink first. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Cheers! ﻿It really is urgent. ﻿Yes. Thanks for accepting. ﻿-You know how much I like you, Richard. -I know. ﻿When people are worried, they come to see me. ﻿I’d like to reassure them ﻿but I can’t always, ﻿I can’t lie. ﻿But they come for your truth. ﻿They may think ﻿but they’re not always ready to hear ﻿what I have to say. ﻿Let’s talk about you. ﻿How long has it been? ﻿-At least 6 months. -Yes, probably. ﻿Let’s see what we’ve got. ﻿Some good news: ﻿you left that man. ﻿Yes. ﻿I did warn you about him. ﻿Indeed. ﻿I ran into him in the street. ﻿Just now? ﻿Just before coming here... ﻿we fought. ﻿Everything is circular. ﻿Think of a dog. ﻿He doesn't walk straight, ﻿he sniffs, he snuffles about, ﻿he retraces his steps. ﻿Then suddenly he barks at a bird. ﻿It takes flight. ﻿Mostly, ﻿the bird stays out of reach. ﻿But it gives the dog something to follow. ﻿Gets him moving on. ﻿He's changed places. ﻿ ﻿You’re not barking yet, but you will. ﻿- I’ll continue. - Yes. ﻿You’ve lost someone recently, ﻿someone close, ﻿the bond of filiation. ﻿Yeah. ﻿My father... ﻿Shh! You know the rules. ﻿You’re on the cliff edge ﻿where your father just jumped. ﻿He wasn’t immortal. ﻿You’re holding your mother’s hand. ﻿Next time, it’s her, ﻿then it’s you. ﻿I know! ﻿You’ve just understood ﻿your mortality. ﻿You don’t yet know ﻿that your father is within you. ﻿Sorry. ﻿With you. ﻿You see him? ﻿No. I don't know how to do that. ﻿That's not my domain. ﻿Let's continue? ﻿Yes. ﻿I see a meeting, ﻿spectacular, ﻿it’s meant to be. ﻿A man, ﻿a handsome man. ﻿An artist perhaps. ﻿A prince, ﻿a king amongst men. ﻿It's good news. ﻿I’m happy for you, Richard. ﻿The session is over, ﻿I’ve seen what I had to see. ﻿Another glass? ﻿Yes! ﻿Thank you. ﻿I’ve just walked off set. ﻿ ﻿You’ve dropped everything? ﻿I don’t know. ﻿I don't know what to do next. ﻿Look within. The answer's inside you. ﻿You've shut the door too quickly. ﻿Reopen it. ﻿Close others. ﻿Let some air in. ﻿Take a step back, if necessary. ﻿ ﻿Look to the horizon. ﻿Come back and see me soon. ﻿You'll have things to tell ﻿Thank you so much, Samantha. Really. Thanks. ﻿I know my way out. ﻿Good evening. ﻿Goodbye. ﻿Good evening. ﻿Sorry Maurice, I fell asleep. ﻿See you tomorrow. ﻿Goodnight. ﻿Are you here for the night of remembrance? ﻿I’m sorry? ﻿God never sleeps! ﻿Join us! ﻿-Good evening. -Good evening. ﻿There’s nobody here yet but the church is open all night. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Are you praying? ﻿Are you praying? ﻿I don’t know. Perhaps. ﻿I saw you and wondered why a handsome man ﻿would be in church at night. ﻿I’m here by chance. ﻿Chance can work wonders. ﻿I’m not here by chance. ﻿-I’m always in church. -At night? ﻿There’s no one about. ﻿It's calm. ﻿I watch. ﻿I listen. ﻿I hear souls speak. ﻿Lost souls mostly. ﻿Then I saw you. ﻿You walk with grace. ﻿Grace? ﻿There’s a sort of naivety about you. ﻿A fragility. ﻿So, I watched you. ﻿I observed you. ﻿I sought to pierce your mystery. ﻿Every man has a mystery. ﻿This place lends itself to spirituality. ﻿Spirituality can give us answers. ﻿I’m not asking the question. ﻿imagine not. ﻿I merely came... ﻿to contemplate. That’s all. ﻿Really? ﻿You came in, ﻿you had a little walk round, ﻿looked at the statues, the lights, the decoration... ﻿even lit a candle. ﻿Attracted by the picturesque, ﻿the atmosphere, ﻿a dose of mysticism. Own up! ﻿No one’s fooled. ﻿Least of all God. ﻿I’m not looking for God. ﻿But God sees you. ﻿God is a king. ﻿You came as a tourist! ﻿Christ chased the merchants from the temple. Sounds familiar? ﻿Yeah. ﻿It’s a parable. ﻿They’re facts! ﻿You only see statues, decorations, candles. ﻿Yet it all has meaning. ﻿I’m not really religious. ﻿That says ﻿You’re a fake. ﻿-A blasphemer. -Will you stop! ﻿The church is open to all. ﻿I've the right to be here. ﻿True. ﻿But only to the worthy. ﻿I’m not unworthy. ﻿Because you’re an artist? ﻿Yes. Because I’m an artist. ﻿Artist! ﻿It’s normal to doubt. ﻿You don’t doubt, you know. ﻿Artistically, you’ve done nothing good for ages. ﻿Your love life’s dead. ﻿Your films are worthl^ss^ ﻿You don’t need a church you need a shrink. ﻿Who are you? ﻿What does being an artist*me^an? ﻿You’re not an artist just because you say yoTPa^e. ﻿That's too easy. ﻿An artist has a mission, ﻿a need to transmit his world view, ﻿-to interpret that world. -Yes, of course. ﻿Art must open one to the
