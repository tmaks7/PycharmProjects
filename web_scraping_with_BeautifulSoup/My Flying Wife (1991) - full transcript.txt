There are so many people, run now! Don't let them get away! Kill him! They're catching up! Leave first! Go! Go now! Leave! —Let's go... —Boss! Surround him! Boss! Chan Yu Qun, it's time! Get up! Get up! Stop playing dead! —Let's go! —Move it. Where are we going? —We're going to the underworld. —Underworld? Why? —You're already dead. —What? I'm dead? —There! —Look! What is he doing? I can reincarnate now! He took your reincarnation pearl to register for reincarnation. —What is a reincarnation pearl? —It's like a passport. —He needs it to reincarnate. —Then what about me? You'll be a ghost. You'll have to wait to find a substitute. —Come on! Don't ask. Let's go! —Move it! Come on! Mr Horse, why are there so many people dying recently? Mr Ox, it's because there are so many disasters... and wars happening in the human world. Stay put! —What is this place? —We've arrived! Let's go! It's Boss! Boss! —Why are you all here? —Boss! Darn! We were all slaughtered! I've never touched a woman in my life, and I've died a virgin! This is so sad! —Boss, let's go up and fight again! —Yeah, let's do it! It's my fault. I brought you into the triads. I'm so sorry! I'm sorry! Boss... Boss, are you okay? Are you crying? You're right! He's crying! The big guy is crying! And he claims to be our boss yet he's crying like a little girl. What's wrong with you? You fools! I just won the lottery! The prize is ten million! You've ruined my dream! It's just a dream! It's not real anyway! I always dream to be the boss! Morons! Get back to work... —Go out... —Okay... Don't be so serious! The gang is still here. I'm glad it was only a dream. —Chiu! Chilly! Come here. —What's up? She's called Helen Lo. She owes our boss money. Go and collect the money from her now. Boss, one moment you ask us to repair cars. Then you ask us to collect debts, and then you ask us to be bouncers. How can we handle so much work? You work as a car mechanic on a full-time basis. You work as a debt collector and bouncer on a part-time basis. Stupid car! You cost me my life! You guys spend so much. You definitely need extra income. Hey, stop it! Hey, what's wrong? —Are you okay? —Are you seeing ghosts again? —Yes. —Really? There's one beside you. Are you kidding? Ghosts appear in broad daylight? —Do you go out at night? —Sure! Enough! Burn some offerings so they'll go away. Get back to work... Chiu, you have the third eye. So where do ghosts usually appear? —The bank! —What? Substitutes for sale! It's a precious chance! Have the money ready if you're interested! You need a good substitute for your reincarnation! Boss! What's the matter with you? You pushed me! Larry! Larry, are you okay? I'm fine. —Siu Hung, you're here. —Mr Smartie. What's wrong, Larry? They knocked me down! They did? Don't cry! I'll teach them a lesson, okay? You can come find me directly. You didn't have to queue up. Those who are murdered or died without reason... and couldn't reincarnate and require a substitute... come and queue up! Siu Hung, why are you still here? Officer, my son can't find a substitute. So it's meaningless for me to reincarnate. I give your son a chance every year. If he had wanted to reincarnate, he would have reincarnated already. You're so picky about it. You're putting me in a difficult position! Officer, please give us one more chance. But you have to give others a chance as well. Officer, she's a widow. Don't be so heartless. Heartless? We're ghosts after all. If you want to talk about kindness, wait till you've become human. Understand? How dare you talk to my boss like this! Who are you to talk to me? Get out! You're really arrogant. Do you want me to teach you a lesson? Are you threatening me? I've also been a triad head before. You don't believe me? Oh, so we're on the same side. That's great! Do you think you can bully me just because I look gentle? You guys are not reliable when it comes to character judgment! Boss, whatever you say. Come on, let's have a chat. Don't play the triad card with me. Let's stop it then. If we fight, I'll just be punished in hell, but you'll be fired Show me some respect in front of my girl. I won't make things difficult for you. Goodness gracious! Are you trying to bribe me? This is just a small amount of money. It's far from bribery. This is what I owe you. Have you forgotten about it? —You owe me? Really? —Of course! Law Hai Shan, 19, Reincarnation no. 054321 Cause of death: Jumping off a building Okay. Since we're friends, I'll make an exception. That's good then. Now, I'm a fair person. —I'll give you one more chance. —Thank you! But this is also the last chance! So listen up. Tomorrow at midnight, a girl will jump off a building. You better seize this chance. —No way, I don't want to be a girl! —Don't complain... You don't want it? Forget it then! —No, we want it! Thank you! —Let's go! There are so many ghosts waiting in line. Just take whatever there is! Next! That is the building. Hey, I'll go and get the money. Wait here. I'll be right back. Ghosts again! —Is Helen Lo here? —Why are you looking for her? —I'm here to collect debt from her. —She is on the roof! I'd rather jump off the building than to be hacked into pieces! Larry, it's about time. Let's wait for her downstairs. After you get her Reincarnation Pearl... —Report to the Officer at once! —Okay. Lady, don't jump! Let go of me! You scum, leave me alone! A ghost is looking for a substitute! Come back up first! You want to grope me? Help! Let go... Come back up! Larry, are you okay? A ghost wants to have you as its substitute! Come up! It's so high! Pull me up! Don't let go! Pull me up! Hands off me! Miss, I didn't mean it. —You scum! —Aren't you Helen Lo? —Larry! —Mum, what should we do now? I know what we have to do. You borrowed $30,000, and you're overdue by six months. Prime plus interest equals $280,000! I didn't borrow it! I was just the guarantor. That's why you have to pay for the debtor! Where do I get the money for it? You trying to act pitiful? You can work at the brothel to cover the debt! —No, I won't! —You have no choice! —No, I would rather die! —You won't? You're really asking for it! Let's go! —Move it! —Don't! Boss, isn't this too cruel? It's not only cruel, it's brutal! But what can we do? If we don't scare her... we can't get the money back, and we can't face our boss. —Will you do it? —I'll do it... Now lady, you wanted to do it yourself. I didn't force you! Before she starts work, we need someone to keep an eye on her. I'll do it... You guys? She'll be wasted long before she starts working! —Chiu, keep an eye on her. —Me again? Boss, he's a simpleton. Can he handle it? That's what I like about him. Chiu, go ahead. —Do what? —Keep an eye on her! You can clear the debt slowly. Killing yourself over it? That's really stupid! It'll just be a few months of suffering. Looks like gambling got you into this. —What are you doing? —I'll tie you up. Are you crazy? Your boss only asked you to watch me. He didn't say anything about tying me up! How do I know you won't run away while I'm sleeping? Are you a pervert? You have a room here! Why don't you lock me up in the room instead? If you tie me up, you could rape me anytime you like! Go over there. It's up to you whether you want to change. Brush my teeth clean and I'll get rich soon... I've already paid the electricity bill. Scumbag, you want to scare me? Oh no! I haven't watered the flowers for a few days! She's such a jinx! She came here and all my lights are spoilt! That stinky gambler. Rape you? I have better taste than that. With money, I can get all the women I want at Temple Street. I don't have to rape you. —Ghost! —You scumbag! Because of you, my son can't reincarnate. I'll kill you as payback! Great... I can reincarnate then! You're dead! The God of War is here! You can use it to scare other people, but this has no effect on me. Oh, this is getting rough! Go! Trying to fool me? I won't care even if you take down the flat. I'm warning you, don't come in or I'll kill you! Don't come near me... So what if I do? Watch this! Are you really scared of dying? You sprout nonsense just because you can see ghosts. Fine, to hell with you! You think you are powerful because you're a ghost? —I'll take you down with me! —Take me down? Help... You scum, you want to rape me? I'll kill you! You're all the same! Go to hell! —I'll treat you to some incense. —Help! Open the door...! There are ghosts out here! Help! You think I'm an idiot? You want to take advantage of me? —Find a better excuse! Stupid fool! —This is serious! Hey! Mum, the light is really weird! It hurts my eyes! Mum! Larry, leave now! You can't look into the light! I'll be back for you! Don't be so nosy if you can see ghosts. —You never listen me! —What should I do then? I'll ask Fatt to settle it for you. Boss, your boss is calling you. Pal, don't be afraid. Don't worry. Let's go for a massage first. Qun, what's the situation with that girl's debt? Don't worry, Boss. I've arranged for her to work in the brothel. The debt will be settled in two to three months. —Watch her carefully. —I know what to do. Hey, make it a double session. It's our boss' treat! Okay! Worse comes to worst, he'll just scream at us. Chiu, I'm giving you a heads up. Don't let the girl touch your privates. Got it. Oh, you better share the room with the Boss. Enjoy yourself! Miss, no need to step on my back. Just a light massage will do. —Pretty good! Are you new? —Yes, I'm new here. Why are your hands so cold? Please put a blanket on me. Larry, possess him! Oh no, it's Chiu! Boss, Chiu seems to be in trouble! I'm the Masked Rider! —Chiu, what are you doing? —Hey, what's wrong? Mum, it's fun! Chiu, what's wrong with your voice? Boss, he seems to be possessed! Stay calm... —Hey! —Boss, there's another ghost in here! It's none of your business! This ghost is an invisible one! —Boss, you have to protect us! —That's right! Who said it's not my business? I'm Chiu's boss! Talk to me if you want! Chiu, let's go! Don't touch my son! Boss, I'll call for help! Hey, are you nuts? We're having an argument with a ghost! —What sort of help do you want? —Boss, let's call the police. Do we know the cops well? Forget what I said. —Boss... —What excuse do you have? I'm really scared! This is a reasonable excuse, but we still have to stay. Mum is great! —Let's drown him in the pool. —Okay, let's go! Hey, let's go after them! He said go after them. Going after ghosts? Are you serious? If we don't, we're not loyal to our buddy. But let's just run slower. Let go of me! Don't move! I'm here to save you! Boss, are you okay? Hold him down! I'll get myself possessed! —What? —Go! Please help me! Hands off me! Don't bite me! Darn! Ouch! Why isn't it working? Oh, I left out the incantation! Charlie Charlie Cheap Bom Bom... Let go of me! Boss, are you done yet? My finger was almost bitten off! Wow, Qun, you're fighting among yourselves! Good timing! Lend me the mop! —Do you need weapons? —No need. Just leave! —Just hang in there! Just go! —Why me? Monster! Mom, I'm scared! Don't be afraid. Everything's fine. Be calm. He has dropped his pants! You're really that heartless scum! Larry, let's go to the pool! Monster! How dare you! Stay where you are! Mum, who is he? The God of War! Let's go! Is Boss possessed too? Don't kill my son! How dare you! Mum! You hurt my mum! I'll kill you! Larry! Monster, come out now! My butt hurts! Larry! Chiu, are you okay? Are you okay, Boss? Give me wine! —Wine? Where can we get it? —Give me wine! Okay... I got it! Boss, I'm doing this for your sake. Boss, here comes the wine! Good wine! —Hey Boss... —Are you okay, Boss? —You're really amazing! —Yeah, you fended off two ghosts. —Really? —That's right! —Why is it salty? —Chiu... It tastes like urine! A mop? Chiu... Mum, my butt hurts! Siu Hung, why did you call for me so urgently? I've something to tell you. —What is it? —I'm pregnant. It's your baby. What? I'm going to be a father soon! Then get the money to buy my freedom. Don't worry. I'll come up with something. This adulteress destroyed our village's feng shui! We still don't know who the adulterer is! Pregnant before marriage. What shameless behaviour! According to our rules here, this witch should be drowned! I beg you, Master! Get lost! Since we've been friends for over twenty years, let me warn you. You're not skilful enough to mess with possessions. Fatt, how would I know? I just wanted to scare them off. I didn't know it really worked! He came and went as he pleased. If you do this again, you'll die sooner or later! And how dare you tattoo the God of War's image on you! How can you be a gangster? A little thing like this and you squealed like a pig! Qun, check him out. Hey, he's all red. Pour some iodine on him. Hey, the God of War's eyes are different. It's showing up... You have to pay for your sins from your previous life... You've made a ghost from the south angry. You've prevented the ghost and her son from reincarnating. No wonder she's following you. Hey, what does that mean? Based on my calculations, if he could survive this... he should be able to live a better life. Chiu is my buddy. You have to save him. I'll try my best. Boss, he is blind. Can he do it? How dare you, you bloody fool! I'm blind, not deaf! You're so disrespectful! Fatt, why do we have to make the sacrificial ceremony here? Because she died from drowning. Of course we have to come to the river. Fatt, are you going to get yourself possessed and fight with her? We're civilised people. Let's go for negotiation instead. You're great, Boss... Hey, ask your boys to be quiet. —You're great, Boss! —Why are you so happy? We're here to negotiate with the ghost! You even brought girls along. You think this is a party? Chiu, kowtow forty-nine times. It has to be loud. Fatt, the ground is so hard, I may die from that! If you don't do it, you'll die right away! Are you going to do it? Okay. Orders from God! The song is still here when the song disappears on the rock 'n' roll radio! Here we go! —Start with the kowtow! —One... ouch! Darn! If I go on like this, my head will explode! I'll do it like this. Two! Three! Four! The kid was ignorant and caused the misunderstanding. He made you angry... Oops! As a token of apology, we have paper money for you. Now, we're even. He's great... —Qun, come over here! —Huh? —Qun, come over here! —Okay. What's the matter? —Help me up. —You're kidding, right? My private part is rammed by a pebble. Cover me and help me up now! I don't want to scare the kids. Qun, are the paper money burning all the way to the seashore yet? Almost there. Chiu, are you done yet? I'm done, Fatt. Poor guy! Burn the paper money, and ask the ghost to collect them. What? Are you kidding? Money makes the world go round! Go ahead! Please come collect this, miss... —Please come collect this, miss... —Why? Is she that powerful? —Qun, come on! —Hey! Me again? You're his boss, of course you have to be there! Chiu, bring me the fire basin. Boss. —Are you scared? —Of course not! I'm not like you. I don't do things half-heartedly at a time like this! —Hey, prepare the tea ceremony. —How? Come on, you've been a triad member for years! But I've never had one with ghosts! It's the same. Go on! Buddy...no, I mean Sister. Let's settle this in peace. I've shown you respect, and you should do the same. Fatt, she refuses to drink it. Pour again! Do it! You refuse to make peace? Okay, I'll destroy you. Let me show you my true powers! Hey, tell me if you see her. Not yet. Boss, she's here! Where is she? Don't scare me! Qun, bring over the fire basin! Fatt, the entire gang is counting on you. I won't disappoint you, don't worry. I'll teach you a good lesson! Fatt, your robe is on fire! Help me to put it out! Watch out, Fatt! Your chain is on fire too! Stay calm... It's quiet now. Is it okay now? Go! Is she that powerful? It was that big butt who hit me. Now is payback time! —Mum! —Larry, are you okay? Boss, that little ghost tried to hit your butt. I'm not kidding. It's you who invited trouble! Okay, it's time to show you that I mean business! Stop it, Siu Hung! Officer! —That dude has a big head! —Where is he? How can you do that? Do you know you're breaking the laws of heaven? He has leaked the secrets of heaven! Even so, you cannot take matters into your own hands. Leave with me at once! Mum. —They're gone, Boss. —Huh, they're gone? —Hey Fatt... —Don't say that I'm not skilful. Without me, how could you all be safe now? Yeah, right! You attempted to kill them without approval from the Underworld. You'll be punished severely! My son's reincarnation was ruined by him. Does my son deserve to be a ghost forever? This is fate. I can't help you. Fine, I'll kill him. I don't care about being punished! Why are you so stubborn? Why are you so noisy? Ghosts need to sleep too! Shut up! I'm the Officer of Reincarnation! Do you want me to teach you a lesson? —Go to sleep! —Sorry, I didn't know it was you! Sorry, where were we? Yes, if the substitute isn't yours... I won't approve it even if you bring him here! Don't blame me for it then! Uncle Smartie... Larry! Uncle, the officer is bullying my mum! Hey, you always go against my girl. You're not showing me respect. Smartie, the underworld is a world of law and order. The way she's going after the reincarnation pearl is no different from robbery! Who has that substitute? Let me chat with that ghost. Hey Smartie, are you thinking about illegal trading? Come on. Let's have a little chat. Tell me, and all this money is yours for the taking. Wow, the car is so cute! It's so manly to drive this car! Oh, it's so smooth! It's the most popular model on earth now. Really? Do you like it? If so, then take it. —You're really smart! —Who has that substitute? Let me check. Chung Tin Chiu. He'll die in an accident. His reincarnation successor is... —Smartie, it's you! —What? Congratulations. Look at you, you're all talk and no substance! I bet you'll never give up this chance! Siu Hung, don't worry. I'll give the chance to Larry. —This won't do. —It's okay. Boy-girl relationships are so troublesome. I'm so glad that I'm not into this. Bye! Smartie, you do so much for us, I don't know how to thank you. If you give up this chance, you'll have to wait for a long time. No problem. I prefer to spend more time with you. Larry, I'll give the substitute to you, okay? Thank you, Uncle! Mum said she just saw my heartless dad. You saw that scumbag? Fireball, check him out for me. —Larry, let's go for tea. —Okay. Let's go. Fatt said that you're not out of trouble yet. No, this necklace is yours. Take it back. With this necklace, no ghost will be able to possess you. Don't take it off. Chiu, if you see ghosts again, do keep your mouth shut. You must do more charity work to atone for your sins. Understand? —I do. —Fatt, don't worry, I'll look after him. I'll take him to donate money, sperm and blood. Stop talking nonsense! What a moron! Qun, ask your boys to go out. I have something to tell you. Leave! I've checked and you were the lover of that ghost in your previous life. You got her pregnant, and she was drowned because of you! You dumped her and ran away! Impossible! I'm not that kind of person! Not in this life, but maybe in your previous life. —Chiu! —Huh? Now, your ability to see ghosts is useful. —What's up? —Stay with your boss. When you see ghosts, let him know at once. Fatt, you just told me to keep my mouth shut. And now you're telling me the opposite. I might get into trouble again. Hey, it's better for you to get into trouble than your boss after all! But you shouldn't let him get into trouble. Triads use slang. We can use slang, and the ghosts won't understand. What slang should we use? —Sacrifice. —Sacrifice? Why not make love? Qun, your boy is so stupid! Moron, "sacrifice" means worshiping the gods! Make love? Are you really that horny? You have really disgraced me! Whatever you say! Here's your workplace. Let me know if anything is short. Most importantly, you're safe. Make more love, and make more money. I hope you'll have a lot of business and leave this place soon. Now, don't complain that I always lock you in the room. Now I'm taking you out for a walk. Don't play any tricks. I won't let you off. —Get in. —Okay. Richard, I've finally found you! You scumbag! You cheated me and now you're dating another girl! Darn you! —Hey, stop it! —Get lost! —Who are you, kid? —Die! —You witch! —Stop it! —You want to be a hero? —Go to hell! You scumbag! How dare you hit me! Blood! Kid, stay here if you have guts! I'll be right back! Watch your back! —Hey... —Be careful! I wouldn't have got married if I had known it's so troublesome! Be careful... Are you okay? The scum lied to me that he needed capital for his business. He wanted me to be the guarantor. You were an easy target. You've lost both your money and virtue. I know I'm stupid. It's my fault. I had poor character judgment. But don't worry. I'll work off the debt. Boss, I found out that this street is under Qun's control. Okay, let's end his business! Who is touching me? Ghosts! Help! Ghost! Ghost! It'll take a long time to clean up this mess. —Where's your boss? —Boss! Qun, look, this joint is a mess! —Who did this? —Sacrifices. What sacrifice? You're so useless! No wonder we're raided by other gangs! You're all useless! Boss, not gangs. The ghosts did it! I don't care by whom or what! You're the security here! You have to take care of it! I don't care. Settle this before I'm back! Or else, I'll dock all your pay! Boss... Boss, the mahjong club was messed up by ghosts too. My karaoke club is the same. Boss, there are many "sacrifices" in front of you. Boss, burn them some offerings so they'll leave. Offerings, my foot! They didn't announce before coming! You want to get protection fee? It won't be that easy! Let's go! Boss, getting possessed again? Go to hell! What's going on here? —Go back to where you belong! —Never come back again! Boss, all the sacrifices are gone. Of course! I'm a genius. Boss! Boss... Qun, what are you doing? It's okay. All the ghosts are gone. Yeah, so are the customers! Look at what you've done to this joint! Hey, this is the way to deal with ghosts. Tell me what you would do. If I could, then why should I pay you? You took my money, you have to provide security! I don't care even if your boys have to die! Just take care of this! I quit! You can keep my pay. Let's go! Qun, I'm just kidding! Don't take it so seriously! Who hit me? A ghost did! It can't be real, right? Grand opening! Let there be plenty of business and prosperity! Dig in! Don't worry, I'll filter out the bad customers. —Do you have $200? —Yes. What for? Give it to me. This is my first time. I want to serve someone I know. You're out of your mind! I'll never use a hooker! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Who are you looking for? The Big Bust! Open up. Hi, miss! My my, you're quite pretty. —What? —Be civilised, will you? If I were civilised, I wouldn't visit a hooker. Crazy fellow. Here's $200. Take it. —Wait. —What? What is it? A heads up for you. She has a sexually-transmitted disease. Don't do it. Sexually-transmitted disease? I have condoms and way more than enough. —What are you doing? —Get out! I'm not done yet, bro. I'm really horny. Horny? Go play with yourself. —I don't want to. —No hooker here. Go! —I have lots of condoms. I'm not afraid. —Go! Take your money back! What are you going to tell your boss? I'll reason with him. Don't worry. He's a reasonable man. If he knows you were cheated, he'll be sympathetic towards you. —Fan, what's wrong? —Don't ask. —Ghosts, of course! What else? —What's the matter? Boss is in a bad mood. Don't make him angry anymore. Boss! Why are you taking her around? Doesn't she need to work? Boss, she was cheated. It's really sad. If we force her to be a hooker, it would be too cruel. Girl, what did you do to him? Boss, she didn't do anything. Chiu, don't be cheated that easily. I did see the guy who cheated her. —I don't want you to be cheated. —Just take her back. —You're forcing her to be a hooker. —What did you say? —Are you crazy about her now? —I'm telling the truth. Shut up! —You're not being reasonable... —Shut up! You're useless! You're such a moron! —You're such an idiot! —Chiu, just go... Hands off! Get back to work! Chiu! You have to be patient with your boys. A ghost is messing with you. You don't have to take it out on them. I've never seen you hit your boys. You hit him in front of everyone. He's probably lost all his dignity! How can he be the boss in the future? Chiu is so innocent, I'm afraid he'll be cheated. Chiu is still young, and you have hurt him like that. Maybe he will go and commit suicide. Hey Qun, where are you going? I'm going for a walk. It's useless to drink so much. Just leave your boss. You telling me to jump ship? I'm telling you to leave the triad. You're too honest and kind-hearted to be a gangster. My boss is really kind to me. He even gave me his protective charm. Just leave. I don't need you to stay with me. Why are you waiting for? To go back and be a hooker? Okay, I'll go. But don't commit suicide after I leave. Mum, how long are we going to wait? I'm hungry. Larry, we'll be set once I take off his necklace. Be a good boy. Larry, I have an idea. Go back and take off his necklace. Why are you back? Chiu, you're too kind to me. I don't want to leave you. Don't be like this! I can't live without you. Don't be like this! Let go of me! Give me the necklace! Mum, I made it! Larry, jump into the sea, and that should do it. —Go now! Hurry up! —Really? Chiu! Hey! —Wait for me! Chiu! —Hey! Ghost! Help me! I'm going to swim now! That's great! —What are you doing? —Here you are! Mum, I've got the wrong substitute! Help! —Mum! Help... —This is troublesome! Boss, are you okay? Chiu, wait for me! —Kill him! —Okay! Let's go! —Hello. —Qun? Where have you been? I've been looking for the two of you. We're in Wan Chai Park. Chiu is possessed by a ghost! Don't go anywhere. I'll be right there. Okay, we'll wait for you. Hurry up. Sis, can we go swimming now? Hurry up! My mum is waiting for me! I've twisted my ankle. Let me take a rest first, okay? Let go of me! Why are you doing this to me? Go away... You lied to me...! —Tie him up! —Okay! Time is running out. Follow me. Sit still! Don't move! Fatt, the ghost is really powerful. Can you handle it? She'll bite the dust this time! This is my turf. Will she come? If your boy was caught, what would you do? —Of course I'll go find him! —Exactly! —Qun. Drink it. —Huh? Hey, Chiu is the one in trouble. He should be the one to drink it. Go ahead. There's a reason for it. —Drink it! —Me too? Shut up! Drink up! After that, I'll open your third eye. —Are you done? —Yes. Now, repeat after me. Abracadabra, open your third eye... Open! How is it? What do you see? Nothing special. Oh no! This is really scary! You'll be seeing ghosts in the next seventy-two hours. Hey Fatt, this is really scary! Can you shut it off? No way! You have to protect Chiu. Watch the little ghost, and don't let him move around. —Hit him if he moves. —Let go of me! Don't hit him so hard. You'll hurt him. Not Chiu. It's the little ghost that is getting hurt. Qun, gather up your boys. —Hey, go over there. —Okay... Whoever has hair dangling over his forehead... brush it back up, and wash your face with the pomelo leaves. What's the use? Don't wash it if you want to meet a ghost! Ghosts are more scared of men than men are scared of ghosts. Ghosts are scared of the brightness coming from a man's forehead. If a man is in bad luck, his forehead will turn dark. This is so hard to understand. Are you making this up? Brat! Got you this time! You think I'm an idiot just because I'm blind? Qun, you were lucky this time. Hey, you knew that you hit me previously? Let's finish the job first. We'll talk about it later, okay? —Take a seat. —What for? —To negotiate with the ghost. —Huh? I have to do that? Chiu is your boy, not mine! Sit down! Mum, save me... Qun, pour the tea. No need. —Release my son now. —Okay... of course not! You can't boss me around. Who do you think you are? Hey, don't be scared! We have more manpower. She can't do anything to us. Really? I can get help too. Wait, there's a whole bunch of them! Uncle Smartie, save me! Uncle Smartie! Go get the boy, and kill them all! Save me... Save me, Uncle Smartie! Save me! Uncle Smartie, save me! Uncle Smartie! Don't be scared! Surround Chiu now! Use righteousness as weapon, so they can't get the hostage! —Grab some tools! —Okay! I can't see them! What should I do? —Watch out! —Or we'll die for no reason! Stay put! Be calm! Uncle Smartie! You can't take the ghost away. Come and negotiate now. —If not... —Smartie, think about my son! Stop now! The underworld has already approved Chiu to be my son's substitute. What you're doing now is against the will of heaven. No, it's not! I've calculated his life. He still has many more years to live! You're the ones who are breaking the rules! What's the difference? He'll die sooner or later. Hey, that's another matter. As long as he is still alive... you have no right to take his life before his natural death. Shut up! You heartless scum, you have no right to talk. What heartless scum? I don't even know you. What? You got her pregnant, and now you say you don't know her? Hey, don't accuse me if you don't have proof! Scumbag! Oh, so now you're relying on force again? Okay, I'll show you the truth. I'll take you to see something now. What? Where are you taking me? What? Are you scared? Why would I be? I didn't do anything! Of course, I'm not scared! Okay, give me your hand. Siu Hung, I'll go with you. Hey, what are you showing me? Just wait and see. Just wait! You can come out now. You leave first. What are you looking at? Don't let anyone see you. Go. Having an affair with a girl out here in the wilderness in broad daylight. You're such an animal. Like you said, it's an affair. This kind of thing has to be rushed, right? Creep! There is more to come. Let's go! Siu Hung, speak up! Who is the guy? No, I won't tell. He'll be in trouble for it. You won't tell, right? Fine. Drown her now! Don't... please let me go. Don't do this to me! Help... You saw what happened. Can you deny it now? Don't be sad. Let's go back. It's not like me to be such a coward! Mr Fung! —Where is Siu Hung? —What's the matter? Hey, there's more! I've brought you the money to buy Siu Hung's freedom! —She has already been drowned. —What? Oh, so you're the adulterer! Grab him and drown him! Don't move... —Siu Hung! —Don't go... Don't go! Siu Hung... We died so terribly. Boss, how is it? I'm in no mood for this. Let's go! —He is my son? —He's called Larry. Take him away now. —I can leave, but he can't. —Why? He's hurt by your incense. So what should we do? Use the incense to lead him to the seashore. I'll do it then. Larry, let's go. Larry, let's go. Larry, let's go. Larry, let's go. Larry, let's go. Larry, let's go! —Larry! —Be careful! I'm okay. Larry, let's go! Qun, we've reached the seashore. What's next? Stand aside. I'll go back now. Come out. —Larry, let's go! —Okay. Chiu, how are you? Are you okay? My head is killing me! Qun, Chiu is awake now! How is it? Boss, don't drink so much. It's bad for your health. Who said I'm drinking wine? Can't I drink vinegar? I won't let this go! Officer, why are you looking for me in such a hurry? I want to tell you that Chiu's substitute is no longer Larry's. How did this happen? Hey, I have nothing to do with it! Smartie wants it back. I'm just playing by the rules. Bye! Mum, what should we do? I thought you were an innocent guy, but looks like you had an affair with her! Boss, I didn't. No? Stop denying it, or I won't help you! Denying it is only an insult to my intelligence! Yes or no? Speak up! Speak up! Okay, let's take it as a yes, Boss. Now, since we're family, I'll give you a chance. Thank you, Qun. Don't say that I'm not reasonable. Girl, Chiu doesn't steal, rob, gamble or sleep around. He really loves you, so don't take him as an idiot! Listen, don't think you're beautiful so you can toy with him. If you do, I'll mess up your face and break your legs! —Got it? —Yes. Go into the room! Boss, this is the first time I saw you fly into a rage like that. It was all an act. I was trying to scare her. Rascal, I knew what I should do. I've helped you as far as I could. I bet you haven't bedded her. Though I'm a man of courage and great wisdom, I can't get women. Let alone a poor and stupid man like you. Count yourself lucky to find such a girlfriend. Work hard, don't let your wife go hungry. What about her debt? I'll repay the debt for her. Can't trust you to do it, right? You're broke. Thank you, Boss. You don't have anything good for me. I'm forty now, but I'm still single. I had a pretty wife in my previous life
