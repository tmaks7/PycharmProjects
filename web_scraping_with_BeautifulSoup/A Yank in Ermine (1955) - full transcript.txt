Where you guys going? Got a date with Marilyn Munroe. What? Here, on the base? Sure, didn't anyone tell you? 12 feet wide and three deep. Hey, you! Going places? Oh, we've got our passes, sir. Have you, huh? Sure you're not trying to make passes? Oh, no, sir. I hope you wouldn't doubt us, sir. Look, I don't care whether you two have got passes to the Weehawken pickle fest. Turner's the guy I want. He ain't done nothing. No, it was a case of mistaken identity. Why, Joe, here, was nowhere near at the time, right? Right. Let him prove it to the Colonel. The Colonel? I wouldn't want to keep the Colonel waiting, would you? Come in. Private Turner, sir. Come on in, Turner. Sir, I've got a pretty good idea what this is about. Oh, you have? Why, yes, sir. It's about the ruckus at the service club dance last night. Well, you see, sir, it was Slowburn's birthday - and, well, you know... - Yeah, yeah, okay. We'll talk about that some other time. Mr. Kimp, here, has something to say to you. He's come all the way from London, England to say it. Okay, Mr. Kimp, he's all yours. I represent the firm of Kimp, Kimp, Waterford, and Kim Solicitors. In Britain, that means lawyer. Lawyer? All the way from Britain? Oh, but sir, it can't be that serious? Now, Turner, you listen to what Mr. Kimp, here, has to say and take this thing like a man. I guess the Colonel must be giving Joe the full treatment. I know. Poor Joe. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. You know, Butch, I reckon you and I would be right in there along with him. After all, it was you started that fight, dusted up all that furniture. Aw, gee, Slowburn, it was just an accident. The chairs just kept slipping out of my hands. Yeah, yeah. Would you please say that again? I repeat that upon the death of your cousin, five times removed, the heir presumptive having predeceased the heir apparent and their parents having died in the lifetime of their grandparents leaving know issue, it is incontrovertibly established that you, Joseph Turner, are now ninth Earl of Beverlow. Ninth. Well, what happened to the other eight? The first Earl was beheaded in the reign of Henry the eighth. His successors, I'm happy to say, followed him in tact with it all. Well, congratulations, Earl. The Air Force is proud of you. Just wait til the Pentagon hears about this. If you will allow me to say so, that is the not form of address. It isn't? When speaking to him, you should say my lord or if you are on terms of the most intimate friendship, he might conceivably permit you to call him Beverlow. It's okay by me, Colonel. Thanks, Beverlow. My lord, pray allow me to add my own felicitations. Well, thank you, Mr. Kimp. Thanks a lot. It sure was good of you to come all this way. I hate to hurt your feelings, but... Well, sir, figure it out for yourself. An Earl on my pay? Oh, I should perhaps have added that owing to his late lordship's forethought, your lordship's financial position presents a very pleasing picture. Well, now, that's different. How much? Apart from Beverlow manor, there are messuages, hereditaments, trust funds and investments amounting in value to rather over one million pounds. A million pounds! Boy, even in dollars that ain't hay. Over three million bucks. Three million bucks? Wow! Say, if he's an Earl, does he get to sit in your House of Lords? Just so soon as he has adopted British nationality. You mean, he'll have to renounce his American citizenship? Incontrovertibly. I take it your lordship will have no objection? Are you kidding? Who would give up a thing like that? I'd rather just forget about the whole thing. Now, now, now, don't be too hasty, son. I mean, Earl. I mean, Beverlow. After all, it isn't as if this is just some phoney two-bit continental handle. The British is a fine people. Why, they practically speak our language and a British Earl? That's almost like being a senator. - I know. - George Washington was a Britisher and he made out all right. - Yeah, but I... - I sure admire your patriotism, Turner, but for three million bucks I'd be a two-headed man from Mars. If, perhaps, I might be permitted to make a suggestion? Go ahead. I have the utmost sympathy for with his lordship's qualms, which, if I may say so, do him the greatest credit. Thank you. But, I am equally certain that, to relinquish so great a heritage without due reflection, would be the height of rashness. Yeah, you can say that again. I therefore suggest that his lordship should return with me to England for a few weeks to familiarise himself with our ways and customs, after which it will still be open to him if he so desires to relinquish his title and return to America. He means you should go and have a look-see. Sounds like a fair proposition. Well, Turner, what do you say? Well, sir, there's a couple of buddies of mine, Halliday and Jenks... Yeah, what about 'em? Well, sir, they've both got furlough due soon and I thought, if I could take them along? I don't know. Well, sir, it's either that or I don't go. You sure you don't wanna borrow an aircraft carrier? Okay, my lord, it's a deal. Splendid, splendid. A capital suggestion. Save it, Mr. Kimp. Save it. You haven't yet had the pleasure of meeting Halliday and Jenks. Hey, Butch, look. There's a big town. Hey, Mr. Kimp, we're stopping over tonight, ain't we? Oh, most decidedly. Hey, that's swell. Can we take in a little floor show tonight? As your lordship pleases. There's a certain young lady I want you boys to meet. I think this occasion calls for a little bubbly. Bubbly? Bubbly. Oh, bubbly. What? Champagne. Oh, and waiter, I'd like a word with the manager, too, please. Thank you. What a lot of ladies. Wait til you see Gloria. She's a real doll. Yeah. Well, this is rather interesting. Yeah. Well, what can I do for you, boys? Boys? Don't call this guy a boy. He's a royal Earl. Sure, and I'm Lee Garlington. No, I'm not kidding. Sit down, have a drink. Why not? You're paying for it. Wrong. Beverlow's paying for it. What'd you say? The Earl of Beverlow. This jerk here, right, Mr. Kimp? Oh, surely. Earl? On the level? His lordship has just succeeded to the title. I'm his legal advisor. Well, what do you know? Can I make an announcement on our floor? Oh, no, I beseech you. But, you could do me a favour. - Yeah? - When Gloria's through with her number, would you tell her I'd like to talk to her? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. Hey, this lordship gimmick, this is right? Cross my heart. A word of advice: if the pay's no better than the Air Force, don't tell Gloria. She's a dame with high business principles. I'll tell her. Excuse me, your lordship. Ladies and gentlemen, and now, your favourite, my favourite, everybody's favourite: Gloria Peters. # My guy loves 27 gals and how he'd like to date 'em # # But I must be his only one # # So here's my ultimatum # # Honey, you can't love two # # Honey, you can't love two # # You can't love two and still be true # # Gonna leave on the midnight train # # Bye bye, choo-choo, so long, toodle-oo # # Gonna leave on the midnight train # # Honey, you can't love two # # Honey, I'm telling you # # If you two-time, you can't be mine # # Gonna leave on the midnight train # # Bye bye, choo-choo, so long, toodle-oo # # Gonna leave on the midnight train # # Hear that whistle blowin' # # Along that railroad track # # It means that I'll be goin' # # And, I'm not comin' back # # Honey, you can't love two # # Honey, and still be true # # If you have fun with more than one # # Gonna leave on the midnight train # # Bye bye, choo-choo, so long, toodle-oo # # Gonna leave on the midnight train # # Bye bye, choo-choo, so long, toodle-oo # # Gonna leave on the midnight train # # Hear that whistle blowin' # # Along that railroad track # # It means that I'll be goin' # # And, I'm not comin' back # # Honey, you can't love two # # Honey, and still be true # # If you have fun with more than one # # Gonna leave on the midnight train # # Bye bye, choo-choo, so long, toodle-oo # # Gonna leave on the midnight train # # Bye bye, choo-choo, so long, toodle-oo # # Gonna leave on the midnight train # # Bye bye, choo-choo, so long # # Toodle-oo # That was great, wasn't it, fellas? Certainly was. Joe, you're wanted. Hiya, baby. You were great. Joe Turner, what's all this talk about your being elected an Earl? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Hey now, wait a minute. It was none of my doing. It was something I couldn't help, like being drafted, all because my pop had a limey cousin. I bet you could have got out of it if you wanted to. No, I couldn't. You could to. Ever since we were kids, you been gettin' into jams. Baby, I don't see what you're being so sore at. It's supposed to be some kind of honour. - Honour? - Yeah. Honour don't buy the groceries. What's the pay for being an Earl? Pay? There's no pay. I might have known it. Oh, honey, now don't be that way. I'm taking off for England first thing in the morning. Let's have fun tonight. Come on over and meet my buddies. I don't wanna. I got champagne. - Champagne? - Yes. Well, why couldn't you say so in the first place? Fellas, meet Gloria. - Hi. - Hi, fellas. Hiya, Gloria, why don't you come sit next to me? I heard you singing. Do you dance? Smart guy. Oh, pay no attention to these guys, Gloria. I want you to meet Mr. Kimp, lawyer for the Beverlow. Hey, where's this champagne you been boasting about? Here, we've made inroads. However, the situation will soon be remedied. Is he a little high? No, now listen, Gloria, if everything's rosy over there, I'm figuring on sending for you. Will you come? - To Britain? - Yeah. What about my career? I'm doing pretty good here you know, Joe. I got a specialty number all to myself and pretty soon I might have my name up in lights. What's Britain got to make up for that? Three million bucks, that's all. Is he on the level? Indubitably. Unless of course, his lordship decides to relinquish his title. You mean, give it up? Well, he'll do no such thing, not while he's got me around to look after him. Will you, honey? I don't know yet. Haven't made up my mind. That's why I'm going over, see? To look around. Well, sure. Sure, and I'm going with you. We'll get married in England, in Buckingham palace, maybe? Feasible, my dear. Now, wait a minute, honey, I... Joe Turner, are you running out on me? You always said we'd get married as soon as you got your promotion. Well, you got your promotion. I know, honey, but I might not like it over there and if I don't, I'll come back and be just plain, airman, Joe Turner again, waiting for my promotion. So, you see, you gotta wait til I go over and see how it goes. Okay, if that's the way you want it. You better not keep me waiting too long. Relax, kid. Pretty soon you'll be a lady Earl. Countess, Mr. Slowburn. Whoa. Pardon me, Kimpy, old boy. Well, here's to jolly old England, where men are Earls and their dames is countesses-es. - Jolly old England. - Jolly old England. England. An historic moment, my lord. This is the first time a member of your branch of the family has set foot on English soil since the Mayflower sailed for America. Well, I think it's about time one of us came back, check up, see what's going on over here. Hey, Mr. Kimp, is this my car? Yes, my lord. Hey, how 'bout this, fellas? Crazy, man. Crazy. This is Clayton, your chauffeur, my lord. Hiya, Clayton. I'm very well, thank you, my lord. He don't look well to me. He looks a little flushed. If you would precede us, my lord. What's that? Oh, right. Hop in, fellas. Well, Mr. Kip, where are we now? This is the village. Beverlow Under Willows in the county of Buckinghamshire. Village? Well, when do we get to the county of Beverlow? There is no county of Beverlow. No county? No county. Gloria isn't gonna like that. No, sir. I read someplace that you could dump the whole of Britain in one little tiny corner of Texas and nobody would know no different. We would. Would your lordship care to inspect the village? Yeah, we'd like that. Wouldn't we, fellas? Yeah, certainly would. Hey now, this place is kinda quaint. I kinda like it. Give me Dead Man's Gulch, Arizona. On the site now occupied by the post office, your ancestor, the second countess, was burned at the stake for witchcraft. Nice customs they got around here. You better watch yourself, Joe. You'll end up on the end of a barbecue. Hey, fellas, look what I see. Oh, my. Ice cold, creamy, frothy beer in big glasses. Oh, brother. That's for us, boys. Really? In your position? A common posture? Mr. Kip, do they serve beer there or don't they? Yes, I suppose so, if your lordship insists. Your lordship insists. Hey, Clayton, don't you want a beer? Oh, thank you very much, my lord. Well, come and get it, boy. Hey! Come on! Let's have some service around here. Morning, Mr. Clayton. The usual? Make it beers all around, please. Oh, thank you, Angela. It's so kind of you to help me. Oh, that's all right, Mrs. Horris. Now, off you go and don't worry. I'll look after the shop. Thank you, matron Angela. I'll get back as soon as I can. Well, pip pip. Hey, pop, what is this stuff? We asked for beer. I gave you beer, sir. My best mild ale. Mild? You mean mildewed. My customers have never complained, sir. Well, where'd you get this stuff from? Magnus Sewers Canal? It's hot. Now, just a minute. There are quite a number of you American gentlemen coming her during the war and they learn to like our ways and like our beer the way we serve it. If you're not satisfied, I'll thank you to take your custom elsewhere. Landlord, landlord. Do you know whom you are addressing? This gentleman is the Earl of Beverlow. Eh? Apart from the gross discourtesy to his lordship on his first day in England, I need hardly remind you that his lordship is your landlord, landlord. Beg your pardon, sir. I mean, your lordship. I had know idea who you was or I'd never let my silly tongue run away from me. No offence then, sir. Uh, my lord. That's all right, pop. Forget it. You know, this beer's good. Kinda grows on you. Drink up, fellas. Are you kidding? Do we have to? Drink up. Come on. My lord, just to show there's no hard feeling, I'd be honoured if you and these gentlemen would have one on the house. Well, thanks a lot, pop. That's mighty kind of you. We sure appreciate it. Well, some other time, huh, fellas? Yeah, sure. Some other time. We'll be looking forward to it. So long, pop. We'll be seeing ya. Good day, my lord. Good day, gentlemen. - Thank you. - Thank you, pop. Hey look, Joe. Does ices mean the same as ice cream? Boy, I wouldn't know. How 'bout it, Kimpy? Substantially, I should imagine, sir. He means yes. You guys hang on here. I'll go in and find out. Hello. Hello. Hello. I see you got ice cream here. Have we? Oh, so we have. Must be Wednesday. We only have it on Wednesday. I'd like about five of them, please. Looking for someone? No, no. Well, there's a couple of buddies of mine outside. I don't want them to come muscling in here. Why? On account of I saw you first. I see. Do you live around here? Oh, not very far away. Do you mind if I come along sometime and say hello? Not in the least. That's great. I better be getting these outside or they'll melt. Bye. Bye. Hey, I forgot to pay you for these. I forgot to ask you. One and eight. Help yourself. You're not very familiar with our money? No, I guess not. I just got in town this morning. Oh. Well, I better run along, but I'll see you. Bye. Welcome home, my lord. Home, huh? Home of the Beverlows for over 400 years. Yeah, cosy little shack, isn't it? How's the plumbing? Adequate. More than adequate. Here is Boone, your butler, my lord. I trust your lordship had a pleasant journey? Well, yes, I did. Thank you very much. Boone, is it? Boone, my lord. You been here a long time, Boone? So far as we can trace, we've never been anywhere else, my lord. There was a Boone in attendance upon the first Earl. Well, now that you've seen me, do you wanna stick around? You bet, my lord. You're okay, Boone. Lead the way, Boone. I think your lordship is expected to say a few words. Such as what? Anything impromptu. Huh? Just give voice to your natural feelings, my lord. Hiya. Well, I just got into town and I haven't had a lot of time to look the place over yet, but from what I've seen, it's pretty swell. Of course, it's kinda old and I've been told the plumbing's a bit on the blink, but we can fix those. What worries me most is this being a lord business. You know, I've been made a lord kind of automatic. It doesn't make much sense to me yet. Funny, I don't feel any different. I'm just an ordinary guy named Joe Turner from New York. Anyway, I'm gonna take the job and try, anyway. If it doesn't work out, well... Then, I'll just go back home. You folks like to stay around and help me run the place? I'd sure like you to. Well, what do you say? Don't you folks speak English? American? My lord. On behalf of your lordship's household staff, it is my pleasant duty to welcome you to your estate and to assure you that the loyalty and devotion with which we have always served your forebears are always at your command. We are Beverlow folk, my lord, and it would be a sad day, indeed, if you were not happy in our midst. Here, here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Three cheers for his lordship. - Hip hip. - Hooray. - Hip hip. - Hooray. - Hip hip. - Hooray. Gentlemen, gentlemen. Splendid news. What's that, Mr. Kimp? We've been invited to tea by the Duke of Fontanham. The Duke of Fontanham? But, that's the guy we're feuding with, isn't it? Yeah, let's go give him a kick in the east wing. But, don't you understand? His grace is willing to heal an age-old breach. Okay, so we'll kick him in his age-old britches. Pray endeavour, Mr. Jenks, to restrain your somewhat bizarre sense of humour. In England, I assure you, a Duke is no laughing matter. Quite so, quite so. Hey, you, there! Where the devil do you think you're going? Oh, it's you, Kimp, is it? I thought it was one of those infernal sightseers. Just because we let the public in on Tuesdays and Fridays, seems to me they come swarming around at any day they like, trampling on my flowerbeds and gaping through the windows. Well, I'm sorry I shouted at you. Well, which one is it? This is the Earl of Beverlow, your grace. Oh, that's mercy, at any rate. So, you're Beverlow. How are you? Fine. Fine, Duke, thank you. These are my two friends, Slowburn Jenks and Butch Halliday. Hiya, Duke. - Glad to know ya. - Me, too. Pleasure. Thank you. Nice big place you got here, Duke. Yeah, makes your joint look like a hamburger stand. Good of you to say so. Hamburger stand, eh? That's dash funny, eh? Am I missing something? Oh, Angela, this is Beverlow. My daughter, Angela, and two friends of his, Mr. Halliday and Mr. Jenks. Do you know what he just said? He said that Fontanham makes Beverlow look like a hamburger stand. Pretty good, isn't it? What is a hamburger stand? I understand it's a sort of refreshment buffet, your Grace. Do they sell ice cream there, Mr. Kimp? What's going on? I know you. You're up to something. We've met before. Oh, you have, eh? Where? In the village shop. Mrs. Horris had to go up to London. The joke's on me, Duke. I thought she was the regular girl. Well, since you two seem to know each other, perhaps Angela better show you around, eh? Would you like that? Yes, indeed I would. Would you gentlemen care for some refreshments? - Certainly, Duke. - Yes, please. That was sure good ice cream we had the other day. Look, your ladyship, if I was at all fresh in the shop, I'll hope you'll forget it. Oh, if you were, I doubt it. I prefer to remember it. And, my name's Angela. Well, Angela, would I be stepping out of line if I told you my name was Joe? Joe? I like Joe. You do? As a matter of fact, my first love was Joe. His father was a German boxer and his mother was an Afghan. He's the cutest little ball of fluff you ever saw. Oh, I get it. A shaggy dog story, huh? Shaggy, but very sweet. So, you see, I'm pray to distant favour of Joes. Well, in that case, I'm glad I wasn't named for my uncle Ezra. How about you Mr. Herridan? Have another muffin? If it's all the same with you, Duke, I'd sooner have another one of those cookies. Cookies? Oh, here you are at last. I'm afraid we had to start without you. Oh, please, sit down. I've been showing Joe the stables. Showing who? Oh, yes, of course. There's no signs of Bertram yet. What's the use of your having a fiance if he doesn't keep his engagements, what? Sounds like him now. You know Bertram, the old chap, was a poor skimp. Lord Provis' son? Yes, that's right. Very good chap. You must get him to show you the ropes, Beverlow. There you are. I thought you said you were coming to tea. Sorry, sir. Spot of bother with the old automobile. Hello, pudge-face. Hello, Bertie. Oh, you haven't met Beverlow, have you? This is Maltravers, the chap I was telling you about. How do you do? How do you do? And, these are two of Beverlow's friends, Mr... Slowburn Jenks and Butch Halliday, over there. How are you? I'm fine, how are you. Mr. Kimp, of course you know. Good afternoon. Heard their brandy's worse in America. Think you would like being a Beverlow? Well, I don't know yet. It's got a lot of angles I hadn't figured on. Don't you worry, old chap. Once you get the hang of it, it'll be a piece of cake. Oh, by the way, what about the rugby match? By jove, yes. Thank for reminding me. Has anyone told you about the rugby match? Beverlow versus Fontanham? It's been an annual battle ever since the game was invented. And, Fontanham has won the last 10 matches. Well, it's about time we put Beverlow back on the map, then. You do play? Well, I'm supposed to be pretty good at real football, but I understand rugby's kind of a sissy game. I say, steady on, old boy. I think I know what lord Beverlow means. I know only too well what Beverlow means. Well, don't take it to heart, daddy. Oh, no, of course not, but it seems rather an odd way for a Beverlow to speak about rugby. Well, I'm sorry if I spoke out of turn, sir. I guess your rugby's kinda sacred around here. I'm afraid we do take our games a bit seriously. You should see us when there's a test match on, even croquet. What's that? Don't be a dope. Everybody knows what croquet is. It's a kind of fancy needlework. Fancy needlework? Fancy needlework, indeed. I'll show you what croquet is. Come along, all of you. Good shot, Duke. Hey, Duke, you've hit my ball. Yes, I croqueted you. Well, it's your turn, Bertram, now. Right. Oh, dear. Now, Angela. Good girl. Now, it's you, Beverlow, now. What do I do now? You wanna go through that hoop, old boy. What? Way over there? Take care. Don't put the Duke through the hoop. That's right, don't put him through the hoop. Knock him for a loop. Watch this Bertram, old boy, old boy. Oh! My greenhouse! Kimp, get them out of here, the lot of them. I should have known better than to let a Beverlow within miles of this place. His ancestors burned down the east wing and now, he's wrecked me greenhouse. - But, Duke, I... - Oh, get out. Daddy, it wasn't his fault. - He couldn't help it. - Oh! Well, how do you like that? Giving us the air. His grace was certainly put out. He was put out? Hey, Joe! Joe, I am sorry. Daddy didn't really mean it. He's a bit hot tempered at times. Boy, I'll say he is. He didn't even give me a chance to apologise. Anyway, maybe I'd better go back where I belong. Oh, Joe, really? And, I think maybe you best go back where you belong, too. Nice to have known you. Come on, old girl. Jump in. Well, so long, fellas. I'm going for a walk. We'll come with ya. He's acting like he doesn't want us along. What's eating him? What do you think, stupid? It's a case of... I fear. Oh, sure. Hey, come here, Butch. I wanna talk to you. I still don't get it. What did that little man mean by the church-y-fem bit? Look, skip it. We got some thinking to do. Yeah. What are we gonna think about? Joe. He's in trouble. He's in bad trouble. - He is? - Well, certainly. We gotta help him. That's right. We're his buddies, aren't we? How do we start? Look, sit down. I'll do the thinking for the two of us. The way I figure it, this guy, Joe, should be the happiest guy in the air force. He's got a swell dump here, he's got plenty of dough, he's got a handle to his name. What more does a guy want? Yet, the poor sap's eating his heart out, but why? I don't know, Slowburn. Look, if a guy ain't happy, what's the reason nine times out of 10? I know, dames. Roger, no guy's a happy guy that ain't got no feminine society. He comes to Britain, he don't know a soul. He's lonely, Butch. He's got us, ain't he? Yeah, sure, but we ain't no feminine society. I guess not. He goes overboard for this Angela dame, then he discovers that she's going steady with this Bertram character. You know what he's novel to do now, don't you? No, what? Pass the whole thing up, go back home. He can't do that. We gotta talk to him. You talk to him, Slowburn. He wouldn't listen. We gotta think of a way to keep him here. Hey, Butch, remember that dame, Gloria, he was go with back home in the States? Yeah, some doll. Yeah, well, supposing Joe was to send for her like he promised? Maybe now, since he met up with this Angela dame, he might not get around to it. Well, that's how we can help him, see? We gotta think what's best for him. Hello, operator? Western Union, please. Wanna send a cable. Pop? Hey, let's buy everybody a drink. Let's liven the place up a little bit. M'lord, you know, I believe you've had enough. Pop, you know, I believe you are right. I'll get someone to drive you home. Night! Night. Hiya, Boone-y. The master's come home. You can bring in the drawbridge now. May I remove your lordship's hat? My hat? Hat, my lord. Oh. Isn't that sensational? Boone-y, I'm gonna give you this little hat. It's wonderful, Boone-y. It's sensational, Boone-y. I don't think you should ever take it off. No, my lord. I've placed a tray for your lordship in the study. Oh, no, Boone-y. I can't have any more to drink. Hey, but where are my buddies? The gentlemen retired about an hour ago, my lord. Drunk? Perfectly sober, my lord. That's disgusting, Boone-y. That's disgusting. Hey, Boone-y, I don't like the look of this guy. He looks mean. I quite agree, my lord. I don't ever have to wear a suit like that, do I, Boone-y? That's not necessary, my lord. Good, good. I'll never make it. I'll help you, my lord. Come along. Oh, good gracious. M'lord, what has happened? It's okay, Kimpy. Boone-y just got a little drunk. What have you got on? Pyjamas. You disappoint me, Kimpy. I thought you'd have on an old night shirt and an old night hat. Where's your respect for tradition? If your lordship will allow me, I'll assist you. You're drunk. You're both drunk. Drunk as lords. Goodnight. Don't nobody get bumped off over here? I think the last time anything happened around here to make headlines was when my noble ancestor, Earl one, got it in the neck. What time is it? - 20 after 11. - Oh. Tell me when it's half past, will ya? I gotta date with Kimpy. He's gonna teach me how to play croquet. I think they made a large mistake. They should have made Butch the Earl. Yeah, another couple of weeks, you won't tell him from a limey. Well, what's wrong with that, for Pete's sake? Limey's okay. You know, Joe, Slowburn's jealous. Jealous? Yeah, on account of Mabel don't go for him. She goes for me. She says I sweep her off her feet. Who is Mabel? She is the upstairs maid. Hey, listen, listen. Oh, what I wouldn't give to be up there. Boy, I'm really fed up with being cooped up in this place. We're getting out of here and fast. What are you doing? Hello, operator? Would you get me American Airlines in London, please? Yeah, that's right. You'll call me back? Thank you, operator. Captain Maltravers, my lord. Morning, chaps. Hello, Bertram. Hi. A bit of a fog in here, isn't there? Just dropped in to find out if you have anything on tonight? There's a bit of a do in the village. A do? Just the usual hopping aid of the organ fund. Won't be madly exciting, but I thought if you had nothing else better to do, you might want to come along. We have nothing to do, period. It's very kind of you Bertram and we sure appreciate it. Is Angela going? Oh, you bet. Must show the old flag, you know. Does she know about you asking me? Us? Know about it? As a matter of fact, it was her idea, old boy. It was, huh? Well, thanks a lot. We'll be glad to accept. - Won't we fellas? - Sure will. - Yeah, sure. - Well, splendid. See you tonight. Well, splendid, see you tonight, village hall, eight o'clock. Must get leaving. - So long. - So long, Bertram. So long, Bertram. Hello? Yes, operator. Oh, my call to London. Yes, well, I won't be needing it now, operator. That's right. Thank you very much. # Before I couldn't find her # # Da da da da da da # # Dee da dee da da da da da da da # # Da da dee da dee da # Certainly is great to hear Joe happy again. Sure is. I guess everything's gonna be all right now between he and that Angela dame. Yeah, I guess so. Hey, Gloria. It certainly was a heck of an idea of yours sending her that cable. Was it my idea? I should have known better than to listen to you in the first place. Sorry, Slowburn. You guys ready? No. Well, come on, come on. We're going to the dance, aren't we? Well, yeah, certainly. Hey, what's the matter with you guys anyway? You look like you just lost your last friend. Well, come on. Snap out of it. We're gonna have a swell time, aren't we? Oh, yeah, sure. Well, hurry up. See you downstairs. Okay. Any particular flavour punch? Strawberry or vanilla, I don't mind. Back in a flash, old girl. Hello. Hello. Would you like to dance? Well, I... It was very nice of you to ask me to come along tonight. Well, I didn't want to be unneighborly. I thought maybe it meant that you had forgiven me. Forgiven you? After the way I behaved at your house the other day. Oh, I think we both lost our tempers a little bit. Let's say we forgive each other. How about your dad? Is he still sore at me? Good heavens, no. He doesn't stay angry long. He blows up sometimes, but the dust soon settles. What goes up must come down, huh? Yes? Evening, Frankenstein. Have the zombies carry in my grips, will ya? I beg your pardon. Is this Beverlow manor or is it? - Certainly. - That's all I wanted to know. Stand aside, buster. Really, madame, you cannot come in here and... I'm Gloria. Didn't Joe tell you about me? Do I understand that you're acquainted with his lordship? Is that a laugh? I'm his fiance. - Oh, no. - How's that? I beg your pardon, Miss. No doubt his lordship failed to acquaint me of the glad tidings. Dig that. The guy cables me, express, in New York, begging me to fly over and be his countess and never even gets around to telling the hired help. An oversight on his lordship's part, no doubt, madame. Where is he, anyway? His lordship and party are attending a dance in the village, madame. No doubt you would like to retire? Retire, nothing. Tell that cab driver to hang around and put my clothes someplace where I can change into something more comfortable. I'm going to that dance. Mr. Halliday, you shouldn't. You never know who might be looking. Why don't you call me Butch? Oh, I couldn't, sir, you being a friend of his lordships and all. Oh, go on. Try it. Butch. Yeah, I kinda like England, but there are a lot of things about it that sure make me mad. There are a lot of things about Americans that make us mad. That doesn't mean we should dislike each other. I still think I should go back home where I belong. You don't mean that. Yes, I do, Angela. If I'd been raised her and knew the rules, then I could play the game accordingly, but, well, I have a feeling I don't belong. That's no good. You don't have to feel that way. It's entirely up to you. What I'm thinking about isn't. Are you sure? Dead sure. You're engaged to Bertram, aren't you? Yes. Yes, I am. You're gonna marry him? Yes, I suppose so. One day. Boy, romance sure seems to amble along over here. If I were Bertram, I can tell you, I'd be in much more of a hurry. It's been one of those understood things ever since we were kids that Bertram and I would get married one day. It was our parents' idea, really. That's a great system. Must save a lot of time and bother not having to wait to fall in love. It works out all right, in theory. Yes, but how about in practise? Hi, Joe! Wow. Hey, Butch, look. Come on. Yoo hoo! Well, look who's here. Hello, fellas. Glad to see me? Oh, yeah, sure, sure. What an attractive girl. I haven't seen her before. Is she a friend of yours? Well, yeah, sort of. Baby! Oh, gee, honey, it's good to see ya. When did you get in? Half an hour ago. I hopped a plan the moment I got your cable. Well, what do you know. You look great, Gloria. Hey, Butch, don't Gloria look great? Oh, she looks wonderful. Yeah. Well, aren't you gonna introduce me? Oh, Angela, I'd like you to know Miss Gloria Peters, a pal of mine from New York. How close can a pal get? The lady Angela. Oh. No kiddin'. How do you do? Charmed, I'm sure. Are you planning to stay long in this country, Miss Peters? Oh, I don't know yet. Are we, honey? Look, Gloria, I don't get it. What are you doing here? What do you mean you don't get it? Joe Turner, did you or did you not send me a cable, express? Cable? What was it she was saying about a cable? Your guess is as good as mine. I didn't send her one. You mean that, Turner? Of course I mean it. Gloria, I gotta talk to ya. There's something I gotta explain. Yeah, plenty. I'll fix you two mugs later. Joe, let's you and me go someplace. I wanna talk to you, alone. Don't go, Angela. Hey, what gives around here? I don't come all this way to be treated like I was interrupting a love scene, or am I? Look, Gloria, I asked you to stay in New York until you heard from me. Joe Turner, I may be a sucker, but I ain't so dumb I can't read. Gloria Peters, Shay Peppy Club, 239 East 42nd street, New York City, UK okay, but can't sleep nights thinking of my baby. Stop. Grab first plane and come right over. Stop. You too can be a countess. Stop. Love and kisses from your early bird. Signed, Joe. Well? I didn't send this cable. I suppose it was two other fellows? Yeah, maybe it was. Joe, please. Say, that was fantastic. Won't someone introduce me? Gloria, this is Captain, the honourable Bertram Maltravers. Miss Gloria Peters. How absolutely spiffy. This is an honour, your honour. I was watching you just now and you were terrific. Don't suppose you'd care to tumble around with me, would you? Well, why not? Okay, your honour. Get with it. Jolly good. Angela, I did not send this cable. Don't let's talk about it. Joe, do you mind? After all, it's no concern of mine. But, it's the truth. I didn't. I said I don't want to hear about it. Let's leave it like that, shall we? I'll be darned if I will. I knew Gloria back in the States. Yes, we had sort of a thing. That was before I met you. It wasn't anything final or definite. It was just one of those arrangements like you and Bertram had. I see. No, you don't see. Well, quite right in what you were saying earlier. We're safer when we stick to our own kind. At least we know where we are. No unpleasant surprises. - Angela, please believe... - Goodbye, Joe. Hello. Hi, Boone. Good evening, m'lord. Mr. Halliday and Mr. Jenks showed up yet? The gentlemen returned some time ago, my lord. They retired immediately. I've taken the liberty of placing some sandwiches and light refreshment in the library for your lordship. Thank you, Boone. Not for me. Well, leave me to it. I'm starved. Very good, madame. Here comes trouble. A fine pair of buddies you two turned out to be. You fixed me, but good. I guess you mean that cable, huh? Yeah, I mean that cable, huh. We were only trying to help, Joe. We thought you needed some feminine society. Yeah. Well, you sure did a swell job. What are you doing with the bags? Packing our things. Yeah, we figured after what happened, you wouldn't want us around no more. Oh, swell. You got me in a jam and then you just take off. Look, we started this thing together and that's the way we're gonna finish it. You mean you don't want us to go? The way things are heading, it looks like we'll all be going home soon. Goodnight. Have a sandwich. No, thanks. Gloria, there's one thing you gotta get straight. I did not send that cable gramme. Oh, yeah? It was my well-meaning buddies, upstairs. You mean that? They just told me. Why, so help me, I'll fix those guys. Oh, forget about it, Gloria. They didn't mean any harm. They were just trying to get us together, that's all. Oh. I get it. I guess it didn't work out that way, Joe. Did it? I guess not and I'm sorry. On account of you falling for this Angela dame? Yeah. Well, what's she got that I ain't got? Okay, don't tell me. Gloria, I feel like a heel. Well, how do you think I feel, throwing up a swell job and telling all my friends I was gonna be a countess? Well, I don't blame you for being sore, but you don't have to worry about the money, anyway. I'll fix that. And, first thing in the morning, I'll arrange for your transportation back to New York. The heck you will. If you think I've come all this way just for you to give me the brush off and ship me back home before I've even got my shoes off, you've got another thing coming. I'm gonna stick around this joint for a while, get me some of that European culture. Okay, if that's the way you want it. That's the way I want it. That's the way it's gonna be. Hey, where do you think you're going? Look, Slowburn, why don't we tell her some other time? You're turning yellow, are you? Look, it was your idea. I know, but Angela might get awful mad if we tell her. She'll get awful mad if you don't. Hi, Angela. Hello. Hello. Hello. Well, you've just said that. Yeah, that's right. So, we did. Well, what's on your mind? My mind? It's on his mind, really. See, well, Butch thought that... Wait a minute, Slowburn. You tell me to pipe down and you do all the thinking. You're the one to call Western Union. Western Union? Oh. Go on. Well, it's like this, Angela. Well, it was our idea we sent Gloria that cable. Joe... Well, Joe didn't know nothing about it, honest. We thought it was gonna be a surprise. T'was a surprise, all right. Well, yeah, you gotta forget it. Yeah, you gotta. We thought we saw our duty and we just did it. You see, well, ever since Joe first saw you, Angela, it's been sort of... Well, you know? You know? - Love at first sight. - Yeah. Well, thank you for telling me. And, you'll forget it? We'll see what happens. That's swell, Angela. So long. - Bye. - Bye. You know, Butch, that was a good idea of yours, that idea was. Come on. Right, I think his lordship's disengaged now. Come on. Would it be convenient for your lordship to receive a deputation from the Beverlow rugby football team? Oh, the football squad. Sure, Boone-y. Bring 'em on in. Hiya, team. Good afternoon, my lord. Might I remind your lordship that tomorrow that annual, and I might say, historic rugby football match between Fontanham and Beverlow is due to take place? That's right, it is tomorrow, isn't it? Well, we'll be out there rooting for you, won't we, fellas? Well, sure. Yeah, certainly. But, my lord, we were counting upon your lordship's participation. You mean you want me to play? Well, it is tradition, my lord, that the Earl, himself, leads the team in person onto the field. It dates, I believe, from earliest times when the Duke of Fontanham and the Earl of Beverlow had at each other with maces and battleaxes and their vassals used quarterstaffs. Don't tell me the old Duke's gonna play tomorrow? No, my lord. In view of his advanced years, his grace has decided to delegate his command to Captain Maltravers. Your predecessor, my lord, the late Earl, invariably assisted, despite his doctor's orders, in taking as active part as his gout would permit. He did, huh? It did not, unfortunately, stop us from losing every match within the last 10 years. You mean, we've lost all the games for the last 10 years? Okay, fellas, you can count on me. Only, tomorrow, we're gonna win. Here, here. Come on, Bertram. Come on, come on. Ooh, retched. Well said, Mr. Kimp. Well played, sir. Well played. Two tries, two conversions. Well done, me boy. Well done. Bertram's playing a rattling good game, my dear. You ought to be devilishly proud of him. Yes. Yes, of course. Okay, now. Ra! Ra! Ra! B-E-V-E-R-L-O-W. Beverlow! They can't make noises like that. It's only a game, darling. Oh, yes, of course. Still, I mean. Really? Ow! Hey, fellas! Come on! Come on! - Now? - Yeah, you heard him. Come on, let's go. We'll show 'em. Good heavens. Now what are they up to? Excuse me, my lord. These two gentlemen, here, will have to leave the field. What are you talking about, pop? They're my substitutes. Substitutes? Yeah, they're taking the place of these two boys that just got hurt. I say, anything the matter? Look, pop, I've been playing football since I was knee high to a grasshopper. You can't tell me if two of my guys... Not rugby football, my lord. You mean I've gotta play 13 men against his 15? Two of my guys get hurt and I can't call in substitutes? That's what it says in the rules, my lord. No substitutes. Well, how do you like that? Oh, look now. I don't see why we can't switch opponents. I mean, lord Beverlow being new to the game and all that? Oh, sir, I don't know if I'd be within my rights alone on it. It says here, in the rules... Oh, drat the rules. Dash it all. It's only a game and we don't mind. Well, if you say so. All right, there. Come along now. You ready, my lord? Right, let's play ball. 21, 48, 32. Hey, that's a foreword pass! Would I do allow that, sir? Oh, yes. Well, might as well. I've never seen anything like this in all my born days. Hey, Joe! Hey, Butch! Keep going, Butch! Run. Go wide! Splendid. Three cheers for his lordship. - Hip hip. - Hooray! - Hip hip. - Hooray! - Hip hip. - Hooray! Congratulations. That was quite a performance. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Yes, magnificent, my dear fellow. Magnificent. Not football, of course, but magnificent. Oh, good morning, my lord. Hello, Kimpy. I'm just trying to get the hang of this golf game. Oh, of course, my lord. What can I do for you? If your lordship could spare the time, there are certain formalities to be completed before your lordship can take your seat in the House of Lords. I have the documents with me for your signature. Hold your horses, Kimpy. I haven't said I was gonna go through with this thing yet. Oh, no, of course not. But, I thought that, perhaps, your lord... Look, Kimpy. I've given this lord business a try like I said I would, but I've come to the conclusion that it's not for me. I appreciate the honour and all that, but, well, Kimpy, I'm like a fish out of water over here. With the fellas around, it's not so bad, but their furlough will be up soon, they'll be going home, and I'll be going over the garden wall. My lord. I know your lordship thinks of me as just an old stuffed shirt. I believe that is the colloquial phrase. But, believe me, I do understand only too well the loneliness of your position. You mean, I should get me a wife, huh? Precisely. Just like that, huh? Oh, there are many eligible young ladies who would, I'm sure, welcome the proposal. Well, what do I do, Kimpy? Put an add in all the daily newspapers? I should hardly think it was necessary to go so far a fiend. There is a certain young lady with the highest possible qualifications living within the proverbial stone's throw from here. Well, if you mean the lady Angela, every time I get within a stone's throw of her she heaves a brick at me. She is a very high-spirited young lady. Besides that, she's gonna marry Bertram Maltravers. I take leave to doubt that, my lord. You mean, you think maybe they could get unhitched, huh? I have no doubt that the proposed alliance between the lady Angela and Captain Malatravers has already, to use your lordship's graphic phrase, become unhitched. As I was coming up the drive, I saw Captain Maltravers leaving in his car, accompanied by a certain red-haired young lady. From that, and the fact that she was sitting on his knee, I concluded that his engagement to the lady Angela was no longer uppermost in his mind. Look, the old man's bound to kick the bucket sooner or later, then I'll be lord Provers. Would you mind ought to being lady Provers? Well, I'm a free-born American that's always voted the straight democrat ticket, but for you, Bertram, gosh. I'd even be a lady. Would you really? I guess so. If only my people and Angela's people hadn't been so confoundedly hasty. I mean, they might at least have waited til we were out of kindergarten. As it is, there's nothing much a chap can do about it. Well, you can tell her you've changed your mind. What? Throw her over? Why, so, old girl. I couldn't do that. Why not? Well, nobody but a howling cad would jilt a girl after they've been engaged for donkeys years. Besides, I'd be kicked out of the regiment, resigned from my clubs, all our friends would cut me dead. You mean pull a knife on you? No, not exactly that, but it would be dashed all, what I can tell you. No, I'll just have to go through with it, that's all. Yeah, but what about me? I'll never forget about you, old girl. No, I'll send you a postcard every month on the dot. Oh, gee, thanks. That'll be swell. There is just one thing, of course. If Angela were to fall for some other fellow and break it off herself... She wouldn't do that with me around. Are you crazy? Crazy? I don't think so. Look, do I have to draw you a diagram? Angela's stuck on Joe. Beverlow? Oh, lord, no. Whatever gave you that idea? And, he's stuck on her, too. But, I thought he was crazy about you? Not anymore, he ain't. Well, I say, you're not pulling my leg, are you? Look, Bertram, listen, will ya? And, I'll say it slow, over again, in words of one syllable. Angela loves Joe. Joe loves Angela. Got it? Well, I must say, this is a rum go. A devilish rum. Good show for us, though, if you're all right? I mean, if Angela really has fallen for this fellow and decides to release me of her own accord, well, dash it, you can see what that would mean, can't you? It will mean you won't have to send me those postcards after all. By Jove, you're right! No more, I would. You ready, daddy? Oh, no, my dear. Just doing my football polls. Oh, don't talk to me about football. Why? Oh, you mean that unfortunate exhibition at the rugby match. Extraordinary business. Still, we mustn't hold it against the fellow, you know? Their standards are different over there. Being successful is what counts with them. If only he'd fail at something for a change. Lord Beverlow, your grace. Oh, talk of the devil. How are you Beverlow? Good afternoon, sir. Hello, Angela. Hello. Well... I just stopped by to say hello. By the way, I hear there's some kind of a horse show coming up soon. You mean the point to point? Ah, yes, that's it. And, I was wondering if maybe you could loan me a horse? Well, of course, my dear fellow. What do you say, Angela? There's Archer or Nearly Blind. They're both sound jumpers. How about Midnight? Oh, come now. Midnight's rather a tricky customer. No, he'll be much safer on Archer. Oh, much. Well, what's the matter with Midnight? Has he got the jitters or something? No, Midnight's a magnificent animal. He's got a heck of a temper. Can't think why I haven't sold him. No one around here can mount him, let alone ride him. I'm sure lord Beverlow isn't the least bit frightened of Midnight's temper, daddy. I expect he's had lots of experience. I've ridden some, yes. Only some? Well, I worked on a ranch one summer in Wyoming. Rode a few of those bucking broncos. I think I can handle him. Poor Midnight. Should we go and break the sad news to him? All right. Nevermind the saddle. You'll break your neck. It's his neck, daddy. Fellow certainly can ride. Magnificent seat. What did I say? He'll ride rings around everybody at the point to point. Shouldn't be surprised if he wins every race. Bad luck on poor old Bertram, hey? Oh, I don't know. There's a lot to be said about being an amateur. I think we'll get a good view. Let's try over there. First, number 11, Midnight, ridden by the Earl of Beverlow. Second, number six, Monarch's Star, ridden by Captain Maltravers. Third, number 10, God's Wing, ridden by Mr. J. Williams. 23 and two 24. Thank you, sir. All right, 10 to one, Black Beauty. Boy, this is more like it. When's Joe riding again? Not until the last race. What do ya fancy? I could do with a beer. I mean what horse, stupid? I don't know. Maybe we ought to wait til Joe. Oh, come on. I got a feeling this is my lucky day. - You have? - Yeah. How much you got there? - Oh, nevermind. - Hey! Black Beauty, 10 to one. Come on, we'll clean up. Oh, cheer up, my dear. It's not Bertram's fault. He rode a devilish good race. Trouble is, young Beverlow's a bit too good for him, eh? He's a bit too good for all of us. Oh, I don't know. First, number seven, Anvil, ridden by Mr. R. Clifton. Second, number 20, Hillary Anne, ridden by Mr. C. Royston Jones. Your lucky day, huh? Aw, quit beefin', will ya? You can't win every time. It's Joe on Midnight or nothing. Okay, Midnight, on the nose. Come on. Oh, here's my man. Well, good luck to you, my boy. May the best man win. Thank you, sir. Well, good luck, Bertram. Thank you, old boy. Bertram, you gotta win this time. I'm doing my best, old girl. You just gotta. It's important. It can't be all that important. I'll try though. Joe! - Joe! - Yeah? Joe, listen, will ya? Do yourself a favour and let him win. Are you crazy? I ride better than Bertram. What do you want me to do, fall off? That's a good idea. You do that. Boy, you are crazy. Like a fox, I'm crazy. Joe, do you love Angela? Yes, I do. Okay, then fall off that horse. Gloria, sometimes I don't understand your logic at all. Look, when I first came out here, you were making out swell with her and then what do you have to go and do? You go and win the football game practically single-handed and now you wanna win all them pretty trophies, so all they've got left to play for next year is poker chips. Okay, go ahead, but I'll tell you one thing, win just once more today and it's curtains with you and Angela. Did she tell you to tell me this? No. Well, then how come you're so positive? Look, I may be crazy, but at least I've got a woman's intuition. I'm telling you, I know. They're lining up. I gotta go. Do you know, I believe the fellow's gonna do it again? Joe. Joe, are you all right? Darling? I say, old girl, I've got a little prezzie for you. For me? Oh! Like it? Like it? Why, Bertram, diamonds is my favourite thing, but say, isn't this Angela's ring? Actually, it was, but she just gave it back. Oh, Bertram! Hey, fellas, look! I'm gonna be a lady. Nice work, kitten. Tell me, did you mean to fall off Midnight? Now, why should you think a thing like that? I don't know. It was a nice thought, anyway. Angela, you're not still thinking about marrying Bertram, are you? Well, you're not gonna be an old maid, are ya? What are you gonna do about it? Grab the first man I meet. Any questions? Yeah. How come you're so beautiful? Silly. I say, it's very civil of young Beverlow to invite everybody out from the point to point. Oh, and here he is, your grace. Well, my dear, enjoying yourself? Yes, daddy, very much. Sir, could we have a word with you? Don't go, Mr. Kimp. Of course, my dear boy. What about? Well, sir, I'd like your permission to marry lady Angela. Quite out of the question, my dear fellow. Sorry and all that. Nothing against it myself, of course, but it is the law. The law, sir? Yes, I haven't been to the House of Lords for a long time, but I distinctly remember there being something on the statute book about it. I don't think they'd abort it without letting me know. Daddy, what are you talking about? My dear girl, I'm telling you there's a law against a girl marrying two men. It's called... What is the word? It's on the tip of my tongue. B, something or other. Bigamy, your grace. That's right, thank you. I knew I wasn't far off. Well, you see, Angela's gonna marry Bertram, so she couldn't possibly marry you too, could she? Daddy, I'm not going to marry Bertram. You're not? Bertram, do you know about this? Well, actually, she gave me my marching orders last night. I asked Gloria to marry me and she said yes. Jolly good show, what. I should imagine that this rather neatly disposes of the legal obstacle which your grace's eye had so unerringly detected. Oh, yes, I suppose it does, yes. Well, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and kiss. Hey, Joe! Can Mabel have the rest of the evening off? Yeah, I guess so, Butch, but you better check with Boone. Thanks, Joe. Hey, Boone-y! What gives around here? They just got engaged to be married. Yes, this calls for an announcement. Yeah, how about that? Hey, Joe, what about a speech? - Yeah, come on, Joe. - Come on, Joe. Making speeches is something I never did win any prizes at, but I'll do my best. You know, when Kimp-y, here... I beg your pardon. I mean, Mr. Kimp first asked me to come to Britain, I wasn't halfway sure I was gonna like it. I guess I needn't have worried though. I landed on my feet all right, but that's not the part of me that's sore right now. Seriously though, most countries are most the same, it's the folks that live in them that count, but we're the same kind of folks. We may do things a little differently back in the States, but we do exactly the same things. Deep down, we're the same at heart and that makes it a pretty nice thing for everybody. Well, I guess that's about all I have to say except, well, you've just gotten yourself a new Earl and that's your bad luck. But, I've just gotten myself a new countess and that's the best lucky any guy ever had. - Hip hip. - Hooray! - Hip hip. - Hooray! - Hip hip. - Hooray! api.OpenSubtitles.org is deprecated, please implement REST API from OpenSubtitles.com
