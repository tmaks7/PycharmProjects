[PERCUSSION IN THUNDER STORM] [PROJECTOR WHIRRING] [OMINOUS SYNTH MUSIC] ANNOUNCER: (VO) The Yablo, or monsters, were here before we were. They came from another dimension three million years ago. Nobody knows what they were running from. When mankind came to be, the Yablo were afraid. Then, fear became war. The wisest Yablo, Nameless, wanted peace. He thought we could thrive together. Neither Yablo nor human listened. When the war was over, there was shame enough to go around. The Yablo went into hiding. WOMAN: Most folk today couldn't find a Yablo themselves. Never. But they're there -- if you know where to look. That's why we're here now, conquering the world, forming governments, and drinking beer at 11:00 in the morning. And what of The Unnamed you ask? Still, he waits. That's... pretty cool. Yeah? Well, I've got a lot more of those if you like. Nice to meet you. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS] [DRUMS AND FLUTES] WOMAN: Hey! Hey, are you my ride? Name's Setsuko. But we're not going to Almeria, I need to be in Agpangi. Light frame, blue cover, fake antenna, and no license, hmm. Are you sure it can't go a little faster? Ah, ah, that's better. The wind is great. I couldn't even believe how hot this place was when I first got off the plane. [DRUM BEAT CONTINUES] I'm here for my work if you're wondering. Of course, you were. Drivers are the great faceless spy force. They go everywhere, and they hear everything. Useful. Did you ever think you would have to become faceless yourself? Nobody would have ever thought you could swallow your dignity like this for so long. It's no wonder your enemies haven't found you. [IN TAGALOG]: I've studied Tagalog for two months now. I understand it, but my accent must be vile. You speak plenty of English though. Here's the thing, Rommel... Nobody can completely disappear. Are you sure? Because- Sigurado ka? Kasi- Let me finish. Nobody can completely disappear. Not without our help. O, hoy. SETSUKO: Like I was saying. Tie his feet and throw the rope around that highest branch. I want his guts to dangle before I cut them out. You were hiding well, but there are only so many rocks to check before you'd scuttle out. Isn't that right, Rommel Romero? Wait, me first. What?! Tie me first or kill me, whichever. BOSS: Oh, pretty lady. Yes, I will tie you up -- but not here. [SCREAMS] [CHAOTIC MUSIC] No, put it down. SETSUKO: Put it down. I said put that down. That's a Yablo, a monster. This creature is protected by the Paranormal Species Act. Put it down. Don't you point any weapon at any innocent creature again. Sorry. I'm Sorry. I'm just gonna shoot on unprotected trees then, okay? I'm not joking, buddy. Okay, fine. Good. So, you do know the Yablo. Like I've been saying, Mr. Romero, we're offering you a job. Who's we? PHASE. PHASE? [SOUND FADES OUT] [ROAR] ANNOUNCER: Nearly 50 species of Yablo have been discovered around the world. And though these species vary wildly in shape and form, they share biological similarities found nowhere else in the animal kingdom. Notably, every form of Yablo has demonstrated nearly human-level intelligence. It is because of that dangerous intelligence that the governments of the world, those in the know, have decided to keep these discoveries as a kind of a open secret. The Yablo have even integrated into Earth's ecosystems. We rely on their biological functions for soil, water filtering, and more. Hi, I'm Giovanni Cortiz. You will operate according to three key directives. Discover: find new species and new information on known creatures. Document: keep extensive record of all discoveries. And to defend. GIOVANNI (OS): Your deployment to the island of Biliran, home of PHASE Central and headquarters and key Yablo population hotspot, is one of the greatest honors your government can bestow on you. We'll make our countries proud. Go PHASE! Okay! Cadets, younglings, whatever, I hope you don't have any questions. Great. So, I'm April, I'll be keeping you safe when we're out on the field which I believe we will be today, so lucky you. Uh, we don't get new people very often. I'm kind of making all of this up. APRIL: Richard? Talk to them now RICHARD: Huh? RICHARD: Yeah, sure. Um, hi. So, my name is Richard. I'm an engineer for Yablo specialized technology. Like this. This is the hydro frack. It emits a one-inch beam and when applied along the skin thusly it can dry completely even to the point of rupture and on some species of Yablo, this is very, very dangerous, even lethal to others- WONDER (OS): Stand up, kids. We're going now. Give me that! It's horrible. This is Wonder as she calls herself. She's like a hippie. APRIL:I mean "biologist." WONDER: Yeah, that's right. Anything we already know about the Yablo, I'm the one who knows it. So, I guess we'll all be working together. MIRANDA: Well, I'm excited. [ADVENTURE MUSIC] RICHARD: Weren't we supposed to have the day off? Boss called us in. He's the one that called it off. Don't they have something going on? I'm suspicious. I didn't know PHASE was such a small group. Uh, hey, tater tot, how can you say that APRIL: when we've got this guy? RICHARD: Ha-ha. MIRANDA:My name's Miranda. APRIL: What was it? Miran- Eh, last more than a week and I'll remember. Hey, don't be mean. Come on, \you gotta earn your na you and this fart-tart both. We can remember each other's names. I'm Benito. Miranda. Nice fanny bag. Nice eyes. APRIL: Yo, Burrito, let's go! Chop-chop. VÃ¡monos. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] MIRANDA: I am a human girl. I am a girl. I am a girl. I am a human girl. [MUSIC STOPS] It's this way, Miranda. I'm Richard. Don't give up on yourself, okay? I think you're gonna do great. Thanks. Uh, I'm not giving up. WONDER: His old lady left him at the altar. He stood there for an hour in his ridiculous suit. [SOMBER PIANO] They're still together if you can believe it. Wait, where were you? Did you hear my joke about his old lady? RICHARD: About who? APRIL: Come on, it's not APRIL: that funny. WONDER: His old lady. MIRANDA: Whose old lady? WONDER: My brother's. BENITO: Who's that? RICHARD: I want to hear it. Nobody laugh. Stifling is in full effect, sir. Why are you wearing a suit? This is a bad time to be wearing a suit. I don't have to answer that question when I look damn good. [LAUGHTER] So, who is that guy? Sir, do these canceled plans have anything to do with us getting all sweaty out here? Like you had anything better to do, Richard? I'll have you know that I had plans that involve a- Okay, listen up. This is a discovery mission. I'll take point. Richard and Wonder will hold our back. Do not shoot the Yablo unless you absolutely must. We've discovered some species in the area that absorb energy as some sort of aphrodisiac. Always double-check with Wonder, or we might find ourselves neck-deep with the infant Tiyanaks. Okay, commence. BENITO: W-wait. What? [OMINOUS DRONES] [OMINOUS DRONES] Oh, my God! The poor thing. It's been gutted. What could have snuck up on a Maagboar? [Hissing] Not many. Let me take her out of here. RICHARD: We have to clear the whole cave before- RICHARD: we can go home. ROMELL: When we get back, we can have a rebirthing ceremony once we're on base. Let's go. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] Sir? What's the rebirthing ceremony thing? Ah, it's the traditional consumption of the recently deceased, supposedly the next young contains the soul of the recently dead Maagboar. Like that one. So those photos from the videos? Those were not real, right? Yablo aren't really that big? Ask Rommel. Wait, so what was your joke about the boss's old lady? Oh, it's just that they kept trying to get married. You know, he's my brother, he's so lame. It wasn't really a joke though. She's not old. She's kind of funny, and a bit of -- Wonder? Wonder. Wonder, hello? Wait, guys. Everyone get over here right now. Wonder? Hold this. APRIL:Wonder? ROMMEL: What happened to her? [Beeps] She i-is alive. Her consciousness is sustained. My guess is that she can still see and hear us. All right. Stand back. RICHARD: Attach these diodes, please. Okay, where? RICHARD: Temples. Thank you. APRIL: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you just gonna electrocute her? RICHARD: No. [ZAPPING] Huh, well, you know what they say. What do they say, Richard? What? Oh God, defensive! [AGGRESSIVE MUSIC] [BATS SQUEEKING] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [SCRAPING] What did this to him? I don't know. Ask him. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [BAT SQUEEK] WONDER: Guys! Look at that! [OMINOUS MUSIC] What is it? I could have sworn it could- Do you think I can get one of these on my wall? Look. [DRONES CRESCENDO] [ALL GASP] [CHAOTIC MUSIC] WONDER: Where are they? It's okay Miranda. It's okay. The pictures are alive! Move! Is this some kind of joke? You're scaring Miranda. It's here! [BLASTS] [MUSIC FADES OUT] I'm so lost, guys. [SCREAMS] [CHAOTIC SYNTH] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [SYNTH STING] Ow. Come on, help guys. Yeah. Why didn't you catch me? 'Cause you're huge. [PANTING] [WHOOSHING, SHRIEKING] [CHAOTIC DRONES] [SOFT THUD] [DISTORTED VOICES] She's getting up. Are you okay? She saved the new guy. Thank you for bringing my friends. Sorry, I hit you. [PEACEFUL MUSIC] RICHARD: I think I'm starting to piece together the mystery of the canceled plans. Why are you guys here? I'm not done with the inscriptions. And I supposed you guys blasted through everything in your path? RICHARD: Well - APRIL: Not everything. WONDER: Only a little This is the resting place of Nameless the Wise. Come on, you guys. Do none of you know who that is? RICHARD: Someone...smart? BENITO: Uh, sorry. Hi, Set. Don't shoot. I don't wanna have anything to do with you. Why did you buy that dress? Momentary lapse in judgment. A $1,000 lapse in judgment that we've been planning meticulously for two months -- two years even. It comes and goes. [CLICK] Don't touch me. I'm not touching you. I just want to talk. Okay, talking. I'm not running away. I just really needed to look at this cave right now. Okay. I've looked at it now. Look, I don't wanna force you into anything. If you don't want to do this then- [ROMANTIC MUSIC] Okay, we're good. Wait. [ROMANTIC MUSIC BUILDS] If we were to get married... We have to do it here -- in this sacred place. Sure. Also, remind me why I would marry you. Because I am humble. I'm - I'm just so incredibly humble, that I'm probably the most humble person that has ever been. Guys, do we -- I mean us two, the two of us make sense? Damn it, Set, I wanna go home! Make up your mind this time! This isn't how I imagined it. I didn't mean -- Marriage is compromise. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [ROMANTIC MUSIC] Oh, brother! You're married. ROMMEL: I am, yes. APRIL: I like it. Wedding in a jungle! I know a good swamp for the honeymoon guys. Oh, yes, stay away from my wife. APRIL: Going once. WONDER: No? APRIL: Going twice. BENITO: Yes, sir. WONDER: Is it really worth being stuck out here all night? RICHARD: How about you? Any opinions? Any strong opinions like mine? [WHOOSHING, DISTORTED VOICE] What the... [DISTORTED VOICE] Permission to fire? Not on your life. VOICE: I am delirious. Huh? [CHUCKLES] What - what am I? What am I? You're the Unnamed and your wisdom is needed in this world. NAMELESS: Yes... Yes, I am. And I remember your kind coming here before, with the fire in your hearts and then your hands scorching the jungle. My grandfather was Japanese. His people invaded this country long ago. Oh, not so long to me, girl. It's still in you, whatever it is, waiting. The rest of you should watch this one. You're right. I am the Nameless. I used to peddle wisdom, but the truth is the world doesn't need wisdom. It needs justice. You wouldn't mind pointing me in the direction of the nearest city? Being nearly omnipotent actually screws up your simple sense of direction. Thanks. WONDER: What do you mean justice Your world for you, our world for us. The way it used to be when things were good. When was that? NAMELESS: Treachery! Treachery! Don't touch her. NAMELESS: There it is. That anger is still inside. Look at her, there's no need to hide, my dear girl. Why would you want to make yourself so much less- [WEAPON DISCHARGES] RICHARD: Who fired?! NAMELESS: Please listen. RICHARD: It was a misfire! Where's Miranda? APRIL: Find her. RICHARD: Hey guys, where'd the wind guy go? NAMELESS: Humans, calm down. RICHARD: Hold your fire. NAMELESS: I said calm down. Miranda. Miranda, I am coming. RICHARD: Look for the glowing sparkle. [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] MIRANDA: What's going on? NAMELESS: You scared the Aswang. Cool it, big boy. NAMELESS: What did I do? You will be coming with us. [RINGING] NAMELESS: Stop me. [MUSIC FADES OUT] [DRUMING AND CHEERING] [WHOOSH] [STATIC] You'll have to do better than that. I know the Yablo, better than you think. Prove it. MIRANDA: You found something in there, didn't you? In the cave. It's what kept him in there. I've always wanted to join PHASE. That's the one. Never seen one that hadn't turned to stone before. Too bad you moved it. SETSUKO: Suit up, you're coming with us. Your world for you, ours for us. What does it mean? The legends say that Nameless is wise. That he'll do whatever is best. Unlike Talux the True who always did what was right. MIRANDA: You know the legends. I know trouble. [ADVENTUROUS MUSIC] SETSUKO: We only have one lead. He's on his way into the city. RICHARD: The city you said? APRIL: And by the city, do you mean another different jungle? Perhaps a swamp? ROMMEL: Nope. Civilization, everyone. RICHARD: No way! Wow, with a real bed?! ROMMEL: We even booked a hotel! APRIL: No way. RICHARD: No back sores tonight! ROMMEL: Hell-yes-way! And for your convenience, you'll be billed straight out of your pay. APRIL: That's fair. RICHARD: Convenience is great. SETSUKO: We'll lay low at the hotel for now. We don't want Nameless to know we followed him. I'll reach out to our contacts to see if he's been seen anywhere. We'll have an early start tomorrow so get to bed early tonight. And stay out of each other's rooms, Goddamnit. RICHARD: Fair . [PEACEFUL MUSIC] RICHARD: Nameless singled her out for whatever reason, then she happens to know all about the sealing orb? It's too much of a coincidence. She seems nice, but I think you're right. This mission is trouble and she can be a wildcard. Don't look at me, you two are the mutineers. I saw her with my own two eyes. That face was inhuman. Isn't safety your job? Did you think we'd be more safer without any dangerous monsters among us? Maybe. I don't want to hurt her. I th-- I think she's scared of us too. You know when she finds out that half the team wants her gone, she'll split. So I think we should make our intentions clear and for sure she'll do the rest for us. She must be with Wonder now. BENITO: Right. We need to separate them and if Xena goes, I think she can handle the beast if things go south anyway. Did you just forget my name? Uh, oh. No, it's April. -Oh, yeah. -April. Wonder listens to you. You'll be able to distract her longer than the rest of us. Wait, you -- you think this is a good idea? You guys, when she hit me it was like getting checked by a dinosaur. I don't know if she's really Yablo but something's not right. Fine, I will go distract Wonder. Perfect. Last, we need a plan in case she won't leave on her own. Something that can handle the wild monster. I've got it. The chair. Go, my frightful Kafir. Bring me the Aswang. [SNARLING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] Do what you like with the rest. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] I'm really sorry. You're always there for me, ever since I met you on that tricad. And I have so much trouble doing the same for you. I sound great. I should marry me. [CHUCKLES] [ROMANTIC MUSIC FADES] [OMINOUS MUSIC] Is there - Is anyone else here? No. Good. What are you doing? Hey. Stop it. Hey, stop it. Hey, Wonder. Whoa! [CHIRPING] The f... WONDER: 'Suko, Miranda. Okay, you're gonna have to tell me what the hell APRIL: was that back there. WONDER: I can explain, okay? WONDER: 'Suko! My God. Are you the one stealing my clothes from the wash? So that thing could be me? No! WONDER: Yeah, I did steal some.. APRIL: Whatever! WONDER: of your jogging pants. Whatever. What was that? It's a Kafir, a shapeshifter. Imitates the victim's wants. Okay. Oh, I didn't know. Hey. There's nothing to be ashamed of. Right? I- I'm not gonna tell anybody. What makes you think that -- [Roar] [SCREAMING] Back to work. [OMINOUS DRONE] Hey, honey. Did they give us more towels? And corporate sent me a list of stuff they want. Uh, this is your department. Could you take a look at these? There is A-42, and a... affidavit to travel. A-42 B, right? Mmm! Mm Hmm. O-okay. Hang on. Don't forget, there's B93 right here copies in triplicate -- triplicate. BENITO: Guys, emergency! There's a shapeshifting sex monster in the area. A shapeshifter you say. Here's your hot dog, Set. Yes. Thanks. If there's truly a shapeshifter here We're in terrible danger. We need to get her out of here. SETSUKO: Call a cab. MIRANDA:I think -- SETSUKO: You will listen to me. [ADVENTURE MUSIC] WONDER: There they are. APRIL: Miranda! WONDER: Think that's really Set? Fire first, think later. [FIRING] [ACTION MUSIC] MIRANDA: Help! [MUSIC FADES OUT] APRIL: Richard! RICHARD: Huh? Scrap the plan. There's an emergency. Find Set, tell her a Kafir impersonator has taken Miranda. WONDER: And Benito. APRIL: And Burrito too! [SOFT PIANO] Oh. How could you not have one? I thought we were on a warpath here. Body armor, check, laser gun, check. Pen and stationery, no. Stop waving those at me. You look like my nagging wife. Okay, sure. I'll take off my shirt if you like? Where is all the paperwork? Here. Do we really have to do this right now? No. Of course not. About a week ago. Stop dragging me back to reality. I work hard to exist in my fantasy world where I research monsters for a living and have self-esteem. Okay, sure. Uh, you got a key? No. Here it is. Honey? Hon? Honey? Hon? [MUFFLED NOISES] SETSUKO: Are you coming? [SQUISHING] [HORROR BEATS] Go! NAMELESS: This is the best I can do for you. History will roll over those who were wrong. I can say however that for you I have respect. BENITO: So you're a monster? Yes. BENITO: You are a gray, bat thing with the rotting skin. I am an Aswang. That's why you look so good. It's not real. KAFIR: Please, kiss me. BENITO: What? MIRANDA: Who said -- KAFIR: And then take me on the floor, oh! I'd sooner kiss a toilet, you freak. MIRANDA: That wasn't me! [KAFIR LAUGHS] I love it when we talk filthy. APRIL: Hey, you! Give us our friend! She's talking about you, yes? You are friends? You know this girl is Aswang, yes? [VILLAINOUS MUSIC] Remind me again what's this guy's deal. WONDER: You're kidding? APRIL: No. It's a Kafir, shapeshifter. "What's this guy's deal?" Hey, Kafir. Uh, why don't you just talk to us, huh? What do you want? What do I want? Um. What are you even doing here? You could be anything you wanna be, literally. KAFIR: I want -- WONDER: Walk the other way. WONDER: Forget all of this. APRIL: All of it. WONDER: Do it for you. APRIL: You. WONDER: Love yourself. APRIL: Eat, Pray, Love. KAFIR: I want- APRIL: Yourself. [ROARS] WONDER: You got this, April? [ACTION MUSIC] WONDER: Shoot him, April! Come on! [GROANING] [GRUNTS, GROANS] [MUSIC ENDS] [SPY MUSIC] [SNIFFING] [LOW SNARL] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [FIRES] [ROARS] Oh, boy. I will tear you limb from limb! We got him! Shoot him, April. Let me go, you traitor Aswang! [FIRES] [GROANING] Don't shoot him! Punch him! [ACTION MUSIC] KAFIR: Ow. Aw, man. Did you kill it? NAMELESS: It'd be better if you just let him bring me the Aswang You really are one of them, aren't you? Yes, I am. I thought maybe you needed saving. Please tell your friends not to worry. I will deliver their truest desire, the exodus of our kind. We leave together back to our own dimension, never to return. Leave man to his rock. Yablo have been here for millions of years. I know how long. I was there. I came over, but I can get us back. What about our homes here? NAMELESS: Some people always want the world to be so complicated. Where I found as I get older that the simplest solution always cuts to the quick. You can't just take a piece of this world and expect no consequences. Trifles really. [GUN COCKING] I really don't wanna hurt anybody else. Anybody else? Your boy is scared. Boy, talk some sense into your fellows. You know that the world will be better with less- Screw off! I don't want any part of this! You freaks can go on and- [CHAOTIC CHIMES] What is this? Yes, actually, I think he's right. Our kinds can never get along. He doesn't mean that. You're just controlling him. No, I'm not. I mean, no, he's not. This is our home. We're part of this world. We're not going to some other dimension just because you miss it. Yeah, you heard her- Enough, enough! I've seen this whole world from my cave. It's survival of the fittest, and there's no question on this planet, humans are fit. We can try to be human, like you are trying, or we can return where we belong. Hey, floating God complex -- let there be light! [SCREAMING] Guys, come on! Go, go, go! Set-chan! ROMMEL: Setsuko! [ADVENTURE MUSIC] Set, go! NAMELESS: This isn't how I wanted it. But take heart. Together we will have tremendous purpose. What is he doing? Feeding. WONDER: What the hell happened? SETSUKO: He cornered us at the hotel, a-absorbed us or something. We were in his mind. He still has Rommel. What is this? She isn't human. I am Aswang. Aswang, also called as Manananggal. Can split in half at the waist and fly. Very strong, devours blood. I was going to tell you guys, I swear. I joined PHASE to do something good. That's all I ever wanted. Someone like you could've done a lot of good. You should've told us. We're just making nice with the monsters after she betrayed us? SETSUKO: Making nice with monsters is what we do. APRIL: He talks real big now. He tried to get me and Richard to get rid of her. It's why we couldn't respond properly to the crisis. We're the betrayer. Nameless wants to remove all the Yablo from the earth and return us to whatever planet we came from. Could be worse. No. You are PHASE. Can't you understand why this must never be allowed? I'm new. Balance. What would happen if 10% of our animals suddenly vanished? Nothing at first. But animals who ate those animals would starve, then those they eat overpopulate, kill ecosystems. then those they eat overpopulate, kill ecosystems. It could go on and on. The Yablo are part of our world now in ways we can't even see. We could have peace but at the expense of everything else. If Nameless is killed, will Rommel survive? SETSUKO: We aren't killing anything. People are dying, Set. SETSUKO:We aren't having this conversation. We don't kill. Not humans, Yablo, or anything. Then what do we do? We get my husband back. [MUSIC FADES OUT] RICHARD: Set? Setsuko? How could we lose her? Mm-mm. Set knows this area. She lost us. I guess that puts Wonder in charge. And where is she? RICHARD: Wonder! [SPITS] RICHARD: Are you taking a crap? No! Just give me a minute. RICHARD: Oh, Wonder! Come over here! It's right behind you! [INSECTS CHIRPING] [GRUNTING, BELLS JINGLE] [EXHALES] Thank you, wise creature. GUIDE: We are the Demonde, refiners of the watercourse. You, human visitors, are rare honored guests here. I'm just glad Old Morales found you. Welcome to our village. But why did Old Morales go back out there? Ancient tradition says when they get old, the elderly Demonde must go into the jungle and starve to death but Old Morales is tough. 30 years out there, he hasn't starved. We just leave him. This is my home. Will you come inside? Yeah. Sure. [MUSIC PLAYING, INDISTINCT CHATTER] DEMONDE: Yeah! Let the party start! [CLUB MUSIC] Yeah! Let the party start! Yeah! You said party! Here, drink this. Okay. What's wrong? Demonde means wild monster but not because they're violent but because all they do is party. [CLUB MUSIC CONTINUES] Whoa-ho-ho! What's wrong, guys? Uh, we're not really in the party mood. What was in that drink? Well, that's a bummer. We can't have that. Right, guys? CROWD: No! No party! But don't worry though. Our special wine there gets anybody into party mood. No exceptions. It's okay, sir. We're fine like this. It's no problem. You party right. For our honor. To Yablo. [CHEERING] And to humans! Together! Together! CROWD: Together! Whoo! [CLUB MUSIC CONTINUES] Karaoke! [MUSIC FADES] [WHOOSHING] âª Oh, oh, yeah, oh-oh-oh âª Yeah, go, sing! Woo! Woo-woo! [CLUB MUSIC] [WHISPERING] DEMONDE: Drink, it is time. RICHARD: Eww! [SCATTERED APPLAUSE] [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [PIANO MUSIC] âª The sound âª âª That saved âª [FEEDBACK WHINING] âª A wretch âª ...so much right now... I hate your guts, I hate everything about you and everything you stand for. MIRANDA: Humans never come here. They have an understanding with the Demonde who feed off the microorganisms in the water, naturally filter it. The water flows from here through every rice field down to the sea. How exactly do they filter it? [LAUGHS] What? We have to get out of here, guys. Right now they're too drunk to stop us from escaping and we're sober enough to do it. MIRANDA: Richard. RICHARD: Ow. Talk to the guard at my seven. I've been watching him and he's a friend of the guard. Talk to him and try to get him to come over here. April, you'll need to walk in a perpendicular path when the guard leaves his post. Trip him into the alcohol, chaos ensues, and we all run out. MIRANDA: Richard! RICHARD: What? When we escape, you'll need to drag Wonder out. Got it? Got it. Okay. Wait for my signal. [CRICKET CHIRPING] [SNORING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [TRUCK ENGINE] [GROANING] [SCREAMING] [SNARLING] [SCREAMING] [AGGRESSIVE MUSIC] [FIRE CRACKLING] AGENT: Hey, stop! Get her! [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [MUSIC FADE] They must have found this place after that ruckus in town. This is your fault, Benito. I didn't think there was any organization meant to deal with Yablo besides PHASE. Hey. Who says there wasn't? Rommel did. Miranda? [OMINOUS DRONE] Move it. Hurry up. [SAD MUSIC] I don't think they know about Miranda. How would they know? Even the Demonde couldn't tell. Well, that gives us the advantage. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [GRUNTS] NAMELESS: You lot again, are you associated with these kidnappers, or have you taken yourselves? I told you we were on the same side. We were not on the same side as anyone who eats people. I didn't eat them. I have... assimilated them. And I'm sure they're really happy. I am, so they are. Now, get me out of this, and once I'm on the ground I'll free you. We are not going to do that I think I can trick you into it. Oh, I shouldn't have said that, now I probably can't. [CHUCKLES] You have to give up now, you're in danger. Yablo have no rights in human eyes, you'll need PHASE's support, or you'll spend the rest of your life as a lab rat, or worse. I want you to hear me out, there is no other way. Our races depend on each other, countless of humans and Yablo will die! Death can't be stopped. NAMELESS: It's the terrible truth of every moment, that it must end, and soon. It is the root of every cruelty, desperate thrashings before an inglorious end. As mortals, there are so many reasons to kill, and so few to stand and endure. And why should we listen to you? I am old. If you're so wise, why are you tied up in the back of a truck? I have a message for the world, these people didn't listen, but the next, they will. This doesn't stop me from speaking, you realize. WONDER: You hear something? APRIL: No, nothing. [ADVENTURE MUSIC] Take that thing out. This is your chance, kill it. SETSUKO: Keep your mouth shut. WONDER: How didn't I see it before? These idiots are PHASE! Get her out of here. AGENT: Yo, go, go. Go. Let us go. Go, go. Go. Let us go. Go! So, PHASE sure is great. AGENT: Atten-hut! Why did you leave your base? I'm sorry we don't an- Shut up! We were in pursuit of a dangerous Yablo, the one that you captured and transported in a truck here with us. What is this creature? Some kind of elemental being. It's not aggressive, which is lucky for us, because it could certainly take out this entire base with ease. If it hasn't escaped containment yet, it will and soon. APRIL: Richard, what the hell are you doing? Girl, you didn't think I'd leave you all out there in the sticks without supervision, did you? Richard's our boy. Now, what do you think it will take to bring that monster back stateside? Hmm? You're holding my report, sir, it's not in my current budget, can't guarantee it. You could build something, you'd have everything you need, no more digging through the trash for parts. I would like that. COMMANDER: Take them away. AGENTS: Go, go, go. Go, go, go, move. MIRANDA: Richard, stop Nameless! You have to stop Nameless. APRIL: You're one of us, Richard COMMANDER: Don't be cute, people, he's not one of you r-- RICHARD: [Foreign] Go, go, go. I always hated that guy anyways. Go, go, go. RICHARD:I can't express how sorry I am. MIRANDALIt's fine, you did what was right in the end APRIL: Like Darth Vader. RICHARD: No, I didn't. PHASE doesn't protect Yablo. We exploit them, however we can. PHASE has gone bad, but I'm one of them. The next thing you know I'll be trying to take over Poland or reprogram Wonder to like boys. You told him? No, I didn't tell thim anything. RICHARD: I'm so sorry. [UNINTELLIGIBLE] APRIL: Wait how, how did you know? I'm a spy, I know stuff. I'm not in the habit of sharing my preferences with work friends, thank you. It's okay, I accept you, sister. We all accept you, Wonder. APRIL: Guys, lay off. [SPY MUSIC] So Nameless is solid now. He's containable. It's kind of a dumb move. He's too smart for that, he's here for a reason. That's right, he claimed to have a message for the world. PHASE has an emergency television override system, in case of a countrywide Yablo crisis, they can take over every channel. How would he know that? BENITO: When he gets in our head, he can read our minds probably. He's an ancient, legendary smoke monster. Could be. SETSUKO: They won't hold him for long, we have to stop him ourselves. [MUSIC FADES] [MUFFLED MUSIC] [SQUELCHING] [BEEPING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] Good evening, humans. I've hijacked your airwaves to make an announcement that will benefit us all, but first, you're thinking, what the [BLEEP] is this? I am Yablo, a monster, one of many, and you've always known us. You tell children we live under the bed or that we'll get them when they're naughty. You're not wrong, but we are not under your bed anymore, we're in the covers with you. We're real, and there are people [UNITELLIGBLE SHOUTS] who will prefer you didn't know that. They prey on us and will continue to do so. Humans are being naughty. [SHOUTING] NAMELESS: War is coming between my kind and yours. There will be death, and my kind knows how best to serve it. We are everything you've ever feared, we are the vision of your very oblivion. [RINGING] EXECUTIVE: What do they want? [INDISTINCT VOICE, MAN SHUDDERING] NAMELESS: Some of us are so small you'll never know we're inside you until you begin to change and add ever more to our horde. The hooves of the Tikbalang will beat upon your roads and your women. It goes on. The horrors we will rain. We know you have your weapons, but those are meant for NAMELESS: men...not nightmares. ASSISTANT: It's everywhere. So listen and listen well, hairless monkeys. [MUSIC CRESCENDOS THEN FADES] I propose that all of my kind, we can just leave. We never wanted bloodshed. We'll go home -- just don't stop us and I'll make it happen. And we've got our first caller. You're on the air. Can you -- can you repeat what you just said? Yes, sir. If you will kindly leave me alone, specifically the top three floors of this building, I will prevent war. I will take all Yablo across the planet and we will return to whence we came. We don't want war. I'll cut you a deal: clear your team out of here for a few days and I'll make sure there's enough deceased Yablo material left over for your research, material that no other nation will have access to, because we'll be gone after that. Sir, the States will go for it, maybe Japan will complain, but if the materials are good... You have yourself a bargain. And you have yourself a future. [DEFEATED MUSIC] [MUSIC FADES] What would happen if 10% of our animals suddenly vanished The Demonde feed off the microorganisms in the water, naturally filter it. The water flows from here through every rice field, down to the sea. The Yablo are part of our world now in ways we can't even see. [BANGING NOISE] AGENT: Wake up. Wake up. PHASE is over. [MUSIC BUILDS] Are we really letting him do this? People have spoken. And what about Miranda? I'll go back, With the others. We can't let this happen. Why don't you get on that? We haven't forgotten you were ready to throw her under the bus. So? He was ready to throw us all under. And Setsuko freed that thing. What about her? That's your employer you're talking about. Not anymore. How can you say that? SETSUKO: PHASE, was a lie. Peace and understanding? Unity? We threw that all away when a good deal came along. We don't care about consequences, we just know tomorrow we'll be ahead. That's what institutions are like. He made it easy for them to look away, and he was right to. Because we know the truth. We know all the harm that could come to pass from something as simple as pulling people apart. Yablo are people. I can't order you guys to do anything. My authority, PHASE, it's gone. So when I'm asking you to find Nameless and stop him, what I'm really asking, is were you part of PHASE, the company that signed you up and paid your checks? Or were you with me? It's not just the Yablo at stake, the whole world could be. We can't just let them be taken. Why are you telling me? I was already saying that. Because it's fine if we all argue and hate each other, Benito, just as long as we hate the bad sludge guy more, then maybe we're a team. PHASE 2.0! Who's with me -- SETSUKO: PHASE is dead. APRIL: Okay We're just us. [ACTION MONTAGE MUSIC] Well, this is all I have on. [MUSIC ENDS] Will we be able to save Rommel? He helped me escape the creature's mind. I'm sure he's still in there. It's important that we don't kill Nameless, not that that's easy. First, because of my husband, and firster than first, because we're not PHASE and we don't kill, right? Right. Anymore, right? We don't kill anymore? I'm kidding. Nameless' plan must revolve around the captured Demonde. There's nothing else here he would want. They will be kept in the Needle, a few floors up. [CROWD CHANTING] Their team is much bigger than ours. Wonder, take Richard and Benito. Hold the gate, make threats, pile furniture, anything to keep them out. April, Miranda, and I will go up and stop that thing. BENITO: I wanna go with you. I've seen so much with you guys, and all I have been is a burden, and sometimes much worse, but if I start right now and give it my all, I can be one of you someday. So, please, let me help you fight the big guy. [CHORTLE] [CLAPPING] What? You cynical bastards, you didn't like that? Come on, Jim, you're with me. But get rid of that fanny pack. April, go with Wonder. RICHARD: I thought it was good. I liked the speech. Where did you say Nameless was again? The Needle. [TENSE ACTION MUSIC] This is where they'll keep the Demonde. We'll need you once trouble starts. Guns won't matter. It's all up to you. All up to me. [HEROIC ACTION MUSIC] Hold up, hold up. Hold up. [BEEPING] I'm reading about 400 different signatures, guys, assuming 50% of those are insects and animals, and a generous 10% margin for error, that's still 180 people. Those guards aren't gonna be holding them back for long, I suggest we roll diplomacy. Do we want to try and talk the angry mob down? Huh? Y-Ye-Yeah, talk. Right. Come on. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] He's absorbing the Demonde. He'll use the energy to open a portal to our original universe. [MECHANICAL WHINE] Stop! NAMELESS: Oh, my God! Will you not just leave me alone? How can you still be pestering me? Where is he? NAMELESS: Where is who? Rommel Romero. Give me back my husband. Oh, that fellow I got with you. He's been in me a while now. He's fully absorbed. I'm sorry, you should have stayed with him really, you'd be together forever now. [CHANTING] Will everybody calm down. AGENT: Who the hell are you? We are here to help. There are things in here you don't want to deal with. Listen you guys, we're gonna clear everything up, all right? Ow! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING, CHANTING] [CHAOTIC PIANO MUSIC] [FIRES] Look out! [HISSING] NAMELESS: I don't want to rub it in, but control doesn't work on an Aswang. You're so naive, she betrayed you like- Shut up. I'm so sorry, Set. Sorry for all of this. I'm so happy you let me be a part of your team. But, I realize now that humans are the problem. Not all of you, but enough. So, please just let us go, Set. You'll find something else. NAMELESS: Control doesn't work on an Aswang -- but this will! [CLANG] NAMELESS: I appreciate the sentiment dear, Aswang. We'll make it to the promised land, together. Ow. WONDER: Are you okay? I was a second ago. WONDER: Here, drink some water. [COUGHING] Oh, you're really not good at this. Are you okay? Can you make through this? Of course. Can you still fight? Nothing can stop me. Here again? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! BENITO: Hey! Hey! [SOBBING] [TRIUMPHANT OCHESTRA MUSIC] NAMELESS: Oh, what? Why? What are you going to do? [TRIUMPHANT ORCHESTRA MUSIC] NAMELESS: This is unexpected. âªâªâª [SCREAMING] [SCREAMS] MIRANDA: Set, I got you. [DEAFENING RINGING] [CROWD CHANTING] [SCREAMING] [HORRIFIC MUSIC] I'm glad you could all be here today. I'm gonna need every one of you to finish this job. Let's get started. Ah, little heroes atop the mountain with cardboard swords, defenders of the status quo. Well, are you gonna stop me from saving the world? [PANTING] He won't kill us, even now. I killed him. You know you didn't. I can smell him. He's still growing. You picked the wrong side. Yeah. Don't do it again. 'cause he tricked us here so that he could eat us. Yes, I did. [RETCHES] [SCREAMING] Don't you wanna stop me? SETSUKO: Nameless. Aswang, you're more attractive than ever, my dear. Have you finally learned to accept yourself, or maybe it's new hair. Don't leave me -- Last chance, Nameless. You could still get out of this. I know you can't see beneath this lovely skirt of mine, but I'm wearing boots, and they are quaking. Don't you ever learn? Look at us. Every time you had us beat, we come back. Every obstacle you throw our way, we demolish. You just signed your own death warrant because together, we- Ah, shi- NAMELESS: What's that? "Together we shi--"? Well, I am inspired. Okay, Aswang. What's it going to be? [HEROIC MUSIC] Where are we? We're mind-controlled. We are all in his head. Or he's in ours. BENITO: Or whatever. [CROWD MURMURING] [MUFFLED MURMURS] [PEACEFUL MUSIC] SETSUKO: We could have had time. Marriage is compromise. [BATTLE MUSIC] They must be desperate if they've taken you back already. Do you really think that there's a future together for our two kinds? MIRANDA: Maybe, we don't know yet. Maybe, we have to get there. NAMELESS: Oh, so you're one of those wait-and-see types? When the world is a ruin, at least you'll know you tried, right? [BLAST] [SCREAMS] [CROWD SCREAMING] [UNINTELLIGIBLE WHISPERING] How? Um... [CLEARS THROAT] Could you pass me that? No! Stop relaxing! We can't give up. [RUMBLING] Richard, lift me up. Everyone! Everyone, listen to me! There's only one way out of here, and that's together. Use your emotions and fight him out of your head. Get angry, get sad, whatever you've got. If we do it together, he can't keep control. Like this. [GROWLS] [CROWD GROWLING] [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] [GROWLING, SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] BENITO: Come on, guys! I've been here over and over. I know this place backwards and forwards, and nothing can get you out, not even your -- [GROWLING] [TRIUMPHANT MUSIC] [NAMELESS GROWLS] BENITO: Miranda! Ow! Ooh! [GROWLS] [ACTION MUSIC] [SNARLING, GROWLING] [CROWD YELLING] APRIL: It's working! It's working! Richard! [PEACEFUL MUSIC] [GASPS] WONDER: Here, stick him with this. It will slow him down. Great. Don't stick yourself with it. Got it. Hey, man, you did it. How did you know he had a core? What? Squishy. What? Squishy. RICHARD: You have to destroy this. [MUSIC BUILDS] [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [MUSIC CRESCENDOS] [EXPLOSION] [FIRES, CROWD SCREAMING] [SCREAMS] It hurts! [WET BURST] [CROWD SCREAMING] [CHEERING] NAMELESS: Fools, you are all fools. Stick together for now only to fight me. Tomorrow, you will each turn on the other, always. Don't kill me, and I'll let the girl go. [CHEERING, TRIUMPHANT MUSIC] [TRIUMPHANT MUSIC] [MUSIC CALMS] [SENTIMENTAL PIANO] [MUSIC FADES] [CHEERING] Miranda!
