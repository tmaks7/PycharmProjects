WATER DEPTH 8.50M DAMN TO THE DAM NO DAM OR POWER PLANT NO POWER PLANT NO DAM WATER DEPTH 12.5M All of this is crazy! Building a dam will ruin the ecosystem. All for a power plant that will end up closing anyway! The tank is damaged, the machines are breaking. Even nuclear authorities are asking for it to be shut down! Exactly, Miss, that's why we need a new water reservoir! That's ridiculous Your priority Madam Mayor, like it is ours', is the safety of our citizens. That is why... I am now asking you, respectfully and very firmly, to please leave. No violence, no confrontation. No one here wants confrontation here, sir. -No one. -Then we all agree. The law is on our side, we did this by the book. Yeah, the law of the powerful, the law of the elite! When it suits you, the law is on your side. Your project isn't lawful. You are destroying the home of protected animals. -Don't you feel bad? -Yes, exactly! One day the accused will switch sides. You'll see. That's your opinion, Miss. Now, for the last time, I'll ask politely-- No, it's useless! We won't give up. We're staying right here! No! What the hell? Get away or deal with us! Stop! Stop! Guys, stop! Stop! Get out of here! This isn't a republic, what a disgrace! Just go! - First warning. - Put the gun down! What are you doing? We'll never give up! We'll keep fighting! They bridged the blockade at Belfay. -They're gonna bulldoze in Far Est. -Where the hell is my brother? Naël! What's is it? They broke through the Belfay barricade. Let's go! Guys! Hey, come on! They've got machines unloaded over here. Come on! Hurry! Let's go, now! Hey! Do you need me to help out here? - All right, you done this before? - I've been a medic before. Let's go, hurry up. Come! - Take this, it's saline. - Yeah, okay. - Tear gas! - Keep moving, hurry! Keep moving! Tear gas! Back away! Get back now! Get back, you! Get back! Just try to get away! Hurry! Last warning. We will use force. Over this way. Keep moving. We got you. He's falling. He's falling! Hey, buddy. Hey! Someone's hurt! For God's sake stop the grenades! Let's get him out of here! Come on, lift! Leave the premises immediately. Tear gas! Shit, where's my bag? Can someone go get my bag over there? - Stay with me, buddy, okay? - Grenade! You okay? This is your last warning. We will be using force. Here you go, lean on this. Are you hurt? I'll get you to the infirmary. -I'll go by myself. Where is it? -No, it's in that direction, - I'll take you. Come on. - No! Naël! We're stay in pairs! - Your sister's there, ask her! - Obey the law... Hey, Myriam! Myriam! Let's get you to safety. We will be using grenades. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Here. Thank you. Take off your clothes. -Huh? -There's tear gas on them. I'll get you clean ones. All right. Cotton. Shit, they really got you. Sit down. Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't touch. Careful. Appreciate it. -Here. -Thanks. -What are you, large? -Huh? -Are you a size large? -Yeah. - Is anyone home? - Yeah, I am! Yann, do you know where it is? I'll make myself more lemon balm. No, I'll make it myself, don't worry. Great, thank you. You hid the laptop here? Yeah. The door, keep it closed. Myriam? - Who are you? - Hi. -What do you want? -Hi, have you seen Myriam? She was gonna give me some clothes. What are you doing here? I told you to wait over there. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah? This way. - I'm too old for their circus. - Hi, Suzanne. -Hi, welcome. -[Greg[ Hi. Hey, a kiss. -But I smell like tear gas. -Don't worry about that. You give me kiss when you arrive. Where are your clothes? Did you go for a swim? No. He was hit by a grenade. What's your name again? - Greg. - Everyone's getting gassed. Even Catherine and Hubert were tear-gassed. -Bastards... Let's go back over. -Are you sleeping here tonight? I got no choice. There's no room anywhere else. Bye. I haven't seen you before. Are you new? Yeah. Did you see how bad it went when they threw that stone? Yeah, it was insane. Those rioters got too crazy. They're not rioters. They know the police will return, so they're showing they're determined. It's all broken, right? That's why it's necessary to establish a power balance, because purely peaceful fights don't work. The government has fun, then sends bulldozers. If no one had physically stood up to them, meaning no one got violent, then all of this would already be under water. [Hubert} And this. This would be the side of the dam. It starts here? Sorry, excuse me. I have to talk to her. See you. Myriam! Hey. How you feeling? Is it healing? Yeah, it's much better. You want a beer? -Thanks. -So I got a situation. I went over there to set up my tent, but somehow I broke it. It won't work. -Appreciate it. -I think I ripped it during the fight. Do you think there's still room at Suzanne's for me? -Well, Suzanne's not running a hotel. -Hmm. -Okay. -I guess that we... could ask over at Fosses Bleues. -We'll figure it out, let's go. -Great. - Clarisse, have you seen Zap? - No. I haven't. - Romain, have you seen Zap? - Yeah, he's inside. - Zap? - Yeah. Myriam? - Do you guys have any room? - No. No way. - Okay. Is it full here too? - Yeah, it has been for two days. -Okay. -Why don't you go ask Béné next door. There might be a spot at the Raccroche. - Thanks. - Okay. Good luck. - Hey, have you seen Béné? - No, sorry. - No? - Check inside. - Is Béné here? - No, I don't think so. No? We might find some room here. - Did you bring something to sleep on? - Uh, no. -No? -No. - Have you guys, have you seen Béné? - No. Shit. Hold on. Is this to watch the cops? No, that's stupid. No, we do bird counts. We report on national level. Some local kids came and loved it. -We're doing it again soon. -Yeah. -It's really cool. -Cool. It's beautiful. Thanks, I built it. - Upstairs, do you have any room? - No, we're all full. What if you push together in the back? Have a look for yourself. - Oh, that's full. - Oh, that sparrow's upset. -It's not a sparrow, it's a nightingale. -Oh, yeah? I don't think there's room here. Let's go check the Raccroche. We'll find a place. -Ah, Béné, there you are! -Yeah? Do you have room at the Raccroche? For him? Uh, yeah, but it's first come first serve. -Okay. -Um... -I'll drop them off and come pick you up. -Okay, we'll wait here. You... What? No, sorry. Um... No, you'll laugh. Well, say it. I'd rather stay with you a little longer. Straight to the point. Follow me. Were you there long? I was in Martinique ten years. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. That's a while. Doing what? I was in a commune. - Oh, really, cool. - Yeah. And I was in a collective to support the prisoners at Fort-de-France. - Oh, yeah. - There's a prison there. We were meant supplying meds there, but in reality their priority is for soap, toothbrushes. They have nothing there. -Wow. -Yeah. -You worked there? -No, I'm a volunteer. Cool. You know what a roadie is? That's what I do. Yeah. It's the thing where you build stages for concerts and stuff, right? - Yeah. Festivals and stuff. - Yeah. I do it for the money, but I... It's something I like doing. You work when you want. You get to move around a lot. -Yeah, nice. -It's not exciting but... Here, look. Here is good. What do you think? Of what? Well, of that tree. Take this off. Hold on, what are you doing? I thought we could chill at Suzanne's? What's wrong? Don't you want to stay with me? Yeah. Yeah. And? You'd prefer we'd count birds together? Well, I was hoping that we could maybe... I figured we could chill at Suzanne's for a while, we could talk a bit, right? We already talked. So, no talking. Hey! Hey! -Where's your bag? Where is it? -All right, I have it! It's here! Piriou saw you. You left the house this morning. Where is it? I went out so I could pee. Calm down. You better shut up and give it back or I'll knock you out. -Give you back what? -So where did you put it? I swear I don't know what you're-- Hey, wait! It's not him. It's not him! We just found it over there, it was in a guy's car. -Come! -Guys on it. Hurry up! Hey, sorry. There you are! Son of a bitch! I have no idea how it got in there. Open the trunk! - Move! - What are you defending here? Throw it away. We'll fight back! - Hey! Get back. - Let go of me! Get the hell out! You don't belong here. Shit! You speak with violence, we all know that. Let go! Let go! Get off me! Let go! Get off me! Don't fucking touch me! Block the machines! There! Block the machines! Go! -Bullshit! -Hurry! Get back! Hey! Come here now! Get the hell off me. Get off me. - Get off of her! - Let go of me! Go! Stop! Film, go head and film! Film! Film your stupid little victory! Well done, guys. Wonderful work, really. So impressive. See how many machines it took you to demolish what we made with our hands? It changes nothing. We'll build the whole thing over. And by destroying them, you're making us closer. Destroy it all. It's bringing us together. Now we're stronger than before. - Monday, you'll destruct! - Monday, you'll destruct! -Tuesday, we build back up! -Tuesday, we build back up! -Wednesday, you beat us back! -Wednesday, you beat us back! -Thursday, counterattack! -Thursday, counterattack! -Friday, drilling rig! -Friday, drilling rig! -Saturday, death to pigs! -Saturday, death to pigs! And on Sunday, you turn and run away! Monday, you destruct! Monday, you destruct! Tuesday, we build back up! Wednesday, you beat us back! Thursday, counterattack! Friday, drilling rig! Yeah, it's me. It's okay, I got what we needed. There aren't any people of interest here. -Coffee? -The grenade lever stayed on the floor. -The what? -The pin. Right. -Coffee? -Yeah, that'd be nice. Appreciate it. Hey, sorry about yesterday. I hope you understand... I get it, don't worry. Last year, we caught a mole. You know, makes you paranoid. Yeah, no worries. Coffee. Do you want some? No, I'm good. We won't rat you out to your boss if you do. No, thank you, but no. You're defending private interests. -Yeah. -Then you know that's not good? Yeah, I know that. Well, then. It doesn't bother you doing that? Last month, we were dispatched to Guiana against deforestation. Today we're sent here to protect digging work. But it's stupid! We do our job, you know. We're applauded after terrorist stuff, but here we just get spat on. That's how it is. Why don't you join with us, then? Bring your kids, if you got any. If you come with us, then you won't need a salary anymore. You've got hens, eggs, a garden over there. Everything you could ever want. And we've got music. What else do you need? - So join us! - Hey, guys! - Well, I'll think about it. - It's done! It's done! - It's accepted. - What's up? The new environmental impact study was accepted! So they can't work here for 18 months! That's great! -That's crazy! -This is amazing. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay, but I gotta leave on work. I have to go to Paris. We were just about to celebrate our victory. I know, I wish I could stay, but I need money. I get it. Well, you brought a nice energy here. -It's cool. Thanks. -Okay. Will you visit? Yeah, I'll... I got some friends who want join ZAD over on the Bure. So I guess we'll see. Okay. But,, if you need people, of course I'm there. Okay. Well, sounds good. Okay, well, I've gotta find a ride before going. -Will you say bye to everyone? -Yeah. See ya. Sorry. Well done, you're good. I don't know how you always manage to be so quick. How do you do it? Have you thought over my request. The Prime Minister is following it, we need to keep a watch on the ZAD. -I know. -In my opinion, he's making it too personal because it's his region. Maybe, yeah. They've been talking about closing the power plant for a while. So is the hold useful or not? The dam is necessary. People need power. There's no power plant without cooling, we need it. Reality has to take over at some point. What should be emphasized is the danger of lawless zones in the territory. Tell them that if they don't agree, to turn to their elected officials, to the justice. Because if a few hundred pissed off people can overturn any democratic decisions what do we do? Okay, great. I'll need to think over timing here. We could wait for the work to restart, or a media sequence to undermine them Send Simon or Aline. They're better than me for this stuff. So, have you thought about me changing groups? We need you where you are, Greg. I'm needed there. The terrorist threat is increasing every day. I mean, I'm good at this, you know that. -It's time to change groups. -But you only been in the field for two years now. Do three more years, keep proving yourself and we'll see how it goes. Give me a small selection, and then we need to talk about Strasbourg and the Climate Summit. Him. That's the old woman I mentioned... -with the house. -Mm-hmm. How are you? How are you? What's this? What's this? What's your name? We are clearly in the midst of chaos and insurrection. 18 MONTHS LATER -Thank you, Mr. Maynial. -You're welcome. We should be expecting several coordinated attacks by radicalized opponents all over the country. Thank you, sir. Sorry, excuse me. - Yes, hello? - Hello, Greg? -We need to go back to the Busset ZAD. -Okay, when? As soon as possible, the two Germans are there. -They've settled into the house. -The high-speed train saboteurs? Exactly. We can kill two birds, one stone. Okay, great. I'll send in Tancrède or Simon. No, it's urgent. You need to go. Sorry, Séverine I can't, I'm preparing for the anti-mobility law demonstration. The prefect asked... You are already known there. and rotation is ending at the end of the week anyway. Wait, I don't understand. I thought we agreed I could extend if I did my job Subject to service requirements. And now I need you at Busset. In the Vosges, the construction of the water reservoir will resume in the Busset forest, between Nancy and Mulhouse. The project, which has been blocked for a year and a half, has just been relaunched with a new impact study. The document concludes that the dam is feasible in exchange for compensatory measures. An arbitration immediately decried by the opponents of the project. Let's listen to the reaction... Anyone home? Suzanne? Anyone here? It's not here. I'm not kidding. Hi. Is the baby yours? -Who are you? What are you doing? -Who sent you here? Wait a minute, hold on. I walked in to charge my phone, when I heard crying, I came up here. -Where's Pauline? -Pauline? Who is Pauline? She's at a rally. Marco was supposed to be here. Man. Wait, so then, no one is watching him? Well, you are. Yo, we are way too busy. So, listen up... Shit. Pauline, are you there? Hey, Suzanne. -How are you? -I'm good. It's nice to see you. How are the others? Myriam, Naël. Yeah, they're good. You must be starving, I imagine. Yeah. Where is Pauline? Did she not feed him? -Pauline is at the protest. -Firecracker, huh. Trust doesn't come easy for some, does it? Yeah. Can you watch him until tonight? My hip just won't let me do it. Actually, I can't do it. Because I... I have no idea what I'm doing. It's not hard. Just take a bottle and he'll be fine. I'll show you. Don't drop it. Greg? Greg? Hey, how are you? You came back? Well, yeah. You know, with the construction resuming, I had to. You watched Théo? Uh, yeah, I... I watched him this afternoon. Thank you. Wait, so he's... he's your kid? Yeah. What? -Yeah. -Wow. I didn't know that he was yours. -So, what do you think? -Well, he's... Well, for starters, he's not annoying. He's very cute, he made me laugh. Yeah, he's really cute. Hmm. Where were you? Uh... Where was I? I was moving around a lot. I went South for a while. I worked a few different places. I tried to call you. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. Like I said, -I moved around a bit and... -I... I wanted to tell you... I wanted you to know... I still would've kept him, but I wanted you to know. To know what? I don't know how it happened either. What are you saying? What... Myriam, we used protection. Yes. Yeah, we did, I know that, but... but he's here. We looked for you, Greg. -Yeah? -Honestly, we looked for you. I wanted to tell you. Because I would have told you to... You know... It wouldn't have mattered. I wanted him, I kept him. The end. Okay. I don't want anything. -What's that? -I'm not asking for anything. Yeah, no, but... Just... I'm just... I'll leave you two alone. Hey, Greg, hold on... Shit! Fuck! Fuck! - Listen, I'm telling you, they know. - How can you be sure? Because they saw him, the idiot. He's a cop I did a course with. The idiot said hello. Shit, we can't lose the Germans. Well, the Germans are here, and they're not going anywhere else. We just need to send someone else. But Greg, I don't have anyone else ready! It's too risky! I can't do it! So, it's going to continue to be a lawless zone where terrorists can take refuge, is that it? Well, terrorists is a stretch. They just cut some wires. Come on, stop it! From a legal view, this is international terrorism. So you're going to drop off the gun, as was planned. We send in the police after, and it's done. - Hello.. - Hello. -Where is Myriam? -She's over there, working on the shed. - Does he have clean clothes? - I don't know. -All right. I'll check. -I'll bring some down. Hey. Oh, hey, guys. Théo, why are you here? I'm sorry for yesterday. I guess I panicked a bit. Yeah, I saw that. So we couldn't find pants that fit, he needed a change. -Why? -He's covered in mud. Mm-hmm. He grew out of his last ones. It's just mud. So you just leave him filthy? Yeah. It's mud, it'll dry off. Right, Théo? Imagine we had to change you every time you got dirty? Seriously. But it's disgusting. Sorry but... You're not telling me how to raise Théo, right? No, that's not it, but... Théo's been with me for nine months already, and things have gone fine. So, we'll just keep doing what we're doing. Yeah. So, what should I do? Set him on the floor? I don't see why not. We'll figure it out if you can't watch him. Okay. Niko? Jana? Where are you going? I left Théo with Pauline. He fell right asleep. Yeah, cool. We could really use your help moving the stage. Are you busy? Sorry, I can't. I have to go. Issue with my apartment. -Already? -Yeah. Here, I want to pitch in for Théo. This is all I have on me, but he needs a new pair of pants. -New shoes too. -I don't need your money. I just haven't been to the thrift store. Yeah, but... , he doesn't have pants, you know? We'll get some, like I said. The communal fund could use it. -I have work to do. -No, no, no, no. I don't want to put it in the communal fund, it's for Théo. - Open a savings account. - Are you joking? You seriously want me to open a savings account? Yeah, well, why not? There's no papers for Théo. Théo was born upstairs in a room over lockdown and no one knew. Are you being serious right now? He's free of the system. But you did... did you register his birth? Does he exist anywhere for the administration? No, he's fully undocumented. But not having a civil status. Myriam, that's a crime. It's as if he never existed. Wait. So, he needs papers to exist? Are you kidding me? No, but... You think was a ghost you were holding in your arms? Okay. Imagine if there's a raid. They'll check him and it's over. They'll put him in a foster home. Do you want that? So, what do the police care? And you know what? Worst case scenario, I'll say you're the father. Then you can get Théo. - Hello? - Did you try calling me? Yeah, call off the police. Call it off now. What, what's happening? I have something... I have something much better. We might catch the Germans red-handed. We put the arm down. That's right. Neutral face. Neutral face, Théo. Neutral face. That's it, don't move. Stay right there. Oh! Oh! There we go. Sorry. -Sorry, I was sleeping. -It's all good. I didn't mean to wake you. Did you fix your apartment issues? Yeah, all good, I had a neighbor take care of it. I'll go sleep in the car. No wait, you should stay. It's all right. Okay. Thanks for Théo. I told you to be careful with that. - That should've worked. - How's it going, ladies? - Badly. - Really? Well, yeah. You can see we're struggling. -We're struggling. -Okay. -Voila. -Now put on the chain. -Seems right. -How so? -I have no idea. -Wow, thanks. No idea. I'll leave you with it. It's a cool bike you got. Well, it will be. -That's nice to say. -Where did you get it? -Lucia found it for me. -There a scrapyard close by? Yeah, near the industrial area. - Ah, all right. On the N4? - Yeah, exactly. Isn't it by that place with all the bulldozers? That it. Right over there. I get pissed every time I think of that place. Why's that. Because they're the ones that came here. We're not sure they're the ones. I think so. They'll take down the warehouse as well, eventually. -Are you sure it's them? -They have the same name as the one over on the Ambazad, so, yeah. Well, let's burn it down then. -Wait, what? -Those bastards destroyed where we live. Why wouldn't we burn the tools down? No. She's quick to react, don't rile her up. Apparently. Instead of burning, just throw sugar in the gas tank, it caramelizes, and when it does, it's ruined. So, why haven't we done that? You really think they're the only bulldozers near here? It would still send a message! Lucia! If you come and destroy the living, we destroy your destruction tools. Sounds fair, don't you think? Yeah, yeah. Well, talk to Naël. Or Jana and Niko. - This is pissing me off! - Pauline, what's wrong? I don't get it. I'm already out of gas and I've barely driven this thing around. Let me see. - Hey, how are you? - Good. Hey, can you watch Théo? - If you want. - Yeah, I haven't showered yet. Okay, yeah. There you go. - Hello, Théo. - Thank you. There you go. What do we have. - Here's his pacifier. - Is it banana? Yeah. - Okay. - See you. See you. All right. There's two entries. One here and one here. We'll put two lookouts. One over here, and the other by the little parking lot. And where are we coming from? From there? - From there. - Yeah, and so then... Not through here, there's loads of cameras. But the highway is there, they'll see us coming. That's not a problem, cars will be going 130 kilometers per hour at night. Through the fields! Easy! - Hey guys. - Ah, it's you! -Have you started? -Yeah. This is so fucked up. - So? - So we're not gonna go this way... -Why are you here? -I found a solution, it's fine. -Where's Théo? Who's watching him? -Don't worry! -I'm just asking who's watching him? -Pay attention. Just pay attention or leave. We're not discussing daycare. We said we only wanted a few people with us, isn't that right? Feel free to leave, no one here will mind. All right, all right, calm down. Let's go outside. What are you doing, Greg? You're embarrassing me. What's going on? What are you thinking? There could be consequences for Théo. -What consequences? -If things go wrong here. Look at how Tarnac ended. And they just cut a wire. For judges, stuff like this... it's a criminal association, it's terrorism. Yes, if we start thinking like that, we accomplish nothing. There's always a risk of it going wrong. You know that. Myriam, it's different now, you have a kid. At Tarnac, they faced fifteen years. They got six months. What happens to Théo for six months? -But-- -Or 15 years? Would you knock it off about the worrying about Théo all the time? -It's getting really old. -I'm not just worried about Théo. I'm worried about you, too. Come on, I've seen worse. I'm a big girl. -Knock it off. -I won't knock it off. There's a plenty of us. We don't need you. What's... What's with this little father crisis? All of these paternal anxieties? What's happening? It's going to be okay. How do you know? I just know. Come on. Come. -Here! Cheers. -Great, thanks. Here. You can't have too much. -He's happy that you're here. -Yeah, that's what it looks like. And I am as well. You know, eventually I have to go back to work? I know that, Greg. Just saying that you're not a bother. That's all it was. All right, let's go. Dance with me! It's late. I should put him down. Let's go! It's a celebration! Here, Pauline. Take Théo, please. I don't know what I'm doing. Come on! Come! The sabotage will be complicated. They're too scared. They're dropping it. But for the Germans, it doesn't matter. Hold on, calm down. Have a seat. What are those documents you asked for? Huh? That girl's civil status. You into social work now? Oh, no, it's just that, she never registered her child. She had no idea that that was an offense. So she's a bit worried. I was trying to help so the child will have a civil status. Greg, are you getting attached? No, Séverine, I don't care about her. You're asking for results, I'm handling it. They don't trust me yet. And I'm telling you, I think the sabotage is dead. You know you can't tell me that. And really, even if they put sugar in the tanks, is it such a big deal? Such a threat to democracy? It's about the government's want to communicate, we don't care about the damage to the bulldozers. And to the heads in Germany, it shows the order reigning in France and in Europe. So, I promise you, we'll go to the end. The only question that remains is the one everyone is asking, "What's the time frame?" I told you, they're still unsure. 15 days is our objective. That's when we arrest everyone, including you. Only the most noncompliant will be charged. So don't touch anything, let yourself get arrested calmly, and you'll get out of custody without anyone doubting anything. No official will be told of you being undercover. We'll deal with the kid's papers. Don't bother with it. Focus on the sabotage. How did everything go? All right. Like a job interview. -Hi, Pauline. -You okay? Yeah. -Want to go with Daddy? -Hi, Théo. Can I take him? -Do you want to go with Daddy? Yeah. -Hello. What's your mommy doing? Look at Mommy. Are you okay? Well, no. Suzanne fell in the kitchen. She didn't break anything, but they want her to stay at the hospital anyway. Man. Will you let me know the time for Saturday? Yeah, I will. Thanks, Pauline. Hi sweetie. Daughter of a mariner Who sailed across the sea Daughter of a soldier Who hates war Daughter of a convict Escaped criminal Daughter of a king's daughter Too poor for marriage Daughter of a woodsman And a smuggler Child of the seven... Police. Please turn off the engine and show us your papers. You've reached Pauline's phone, -leave a message. -Shit. Okay, Niko, you go here! No, here, wait. No, you here as well! Paul! Fissou, come! Cut the fence here, we'll meet up afterward. Here, guys! It's here! Okay, lookouts, in position. Lucia, the pliers! Okay, go, go, go. - Stop! Stop! - Why? - Stop! - Hey! Get down! SECURITY - I'm getting out of here. - Don't! Don't! Stay here. What's happening? Shit. -Okay. Go, it's clear! -Okay, all clear. Let's go! All right. Now! All right, hurry up. Okay. Go! Move, move, move! I'll get the ones over here. - Brice! Brice! - What? -Did you pour it all? Take it back. -Yeah. Thanks. You hear that? -No, what? -Over there. I didn't hear anything. Shit, Greg, are you okay? Where did you come from? Why are you here? I saw some guys on bikes over at the ZAD and I flipped. I was so freaked out. -Is Pauline at the house? Where's Théo? -No, he's with me. He's fine. -He's where? -He's fine, he's in the car. I wrapped him in a blanket, he's okay. Myriam, what the hell? Hey, stop! Naël, we're stopping. Stop now. What? -Let's go. -Why though? Because you saw some cops, we're going. No, I freaked out a little, Greg. - Don't worry, okay? - Hey, what's going on? She saw cops on the ZAD. No. Just guys on bikes with phones. They weren't the police. Yeah. Wait a second, you stupid or something? -You want to stop for that? -Calm down, Greg, come on. Guys at the ZAD making phone calls at 10:00 p.m... No, we're finishing this! We're going back! What other proof do you need? Let's go, now. -No... -Where did you park? Just across the field. Shit. Let's go. Do you need a hand? Myriam, for God's sake, no! What's happening? - Can you hold the lock, please? - Hey! Get that one! - All right, all right, let's move it. - Thank you. Myriam, we're leaving. This way! Myriam, for God's sake! We're going. -Hold on, hold on, hold on. -Come on! -Hold on! -Myriam, please. All right. Let's go! Quick, quick, quick, let's go! Careful! Come on, come on! Go! Let's go, let's go! Is everyone here? - Okay, let's get out of here. Come on! - Hurry up, Fred! You good? What's wrong? But... Greg, what's all this? Come, come! Myriam, get out of here! Get out of here! Come on! Greg! I said don't move! This way! Move forward! I heard a noise over here. He was just here. Let's check further down. There, there, there, Théo. Here, it's okay, honey. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Théo. Théo, I'm sorry. There he is! Over here! Police! Come out slowly. Get up slowly. Slowly. Put them up. Say that again, I couldn't hear. you. I said you're a dirty pig! - You want more of that? - We've done nothing wrong. Béné, there you are! It was horrible... I know, honey. Are you guys okay? Are you all right? Thanks for getting us, Béné. You good? Squeeze in there, you'll fit. I've been locked up enough, I'll walk. I'm walking too. Fresh air will be good. Okay. Hey. -What was that? Can you explain? -What? The cowboys you sent in. That what policing looks like, really? They think they're in Afghanistan? -Were you expecting choir boys? -No, Séverine, that was ridiculous. They were so violent, I had to fight so they wouldn't break my arm. The mission was a success, If a few colleagues got some scratches along the way, that's part of the job. You managed something huge. -The director wants to congratulate you. -Something huge. -I was indicted for assault and battery. -And? What does it matter? If the judges find out a cop was involved, the trial won't be valid. It wasn't a cop though. It was Greg Bernard. Okay. If I do some prison time, then they wouldn't suspect me. We won't take the risk. Go and get your stuff and get out of there. No, hold on, that wasn't the plan. They're looking for the mole. If I leave now, I'm screwed. You're done with the far left, it doesn't' matter. You're moving on to counterterrorism for the time being. It's official. Bravo. It makes no sense. What? Everything we do. Attacking those who fight for the public interest. Did you want to defend democracy? Didn't you say they could be right? Frankly, if we face the facts. These two years... Did they turn you? Now you don't want to leave? No. Then what is it? Is it the girl? You'd rather spend your life with a gutter punk, farming potatoes and wiping her child's butt? -No. Of course not. -Then you leave the ZAD. You okay? Where's Théo? He's resting. Thank you. Really, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I still can't believe this happened. We need to make sure no one else... - Shit, man. - You good? - You okay, man? - Yeah. You were right. You definitely had the right intuition. It wasn't good enough. We've a mole, there's no other way. - There's no way. - Who could have told them? - You took precautions. - Who would it be, anyway? It's probably a wiretap. And it couldn't be a legal one because they would have had to mention it when they took you in. But they didn't pressure anyone with it. That means they're illegal. And we can turn a trial around with that. -Or there isn't one. -Or there isn't one. How did they know? They're keeping Jana and Tonio, Fissou as well. - Fissou? - No way! That's ridiculous! Are you kidding me? He's barely 18. - They're being unfair to him. - Ridiculous. Listen, we have to turn ourselves in collectively. We have to claim a militant action with collective responsibility so they won't accuse us of terrorism or whatever because-- - Because... - It would be useless. It wasn't a demonstration in daylight with journalists, it was 20 of you in the dark. - We do nothing? - No, we don't do anything. Hey. Hey. There we go. Hey, Théo. Last night after everything... The way you kissed me I thought it was... joyful. I felt like... the idea felt joyful. What idea? The idea of... I suppose, of... You and I building a life. All three of us. - They put them all in jail. - Who did they keep? Fred, Tonio, and the Germans, until the trial. Would you mind checking my post for spelling mistakes? If I left, would you come with me? What? Leave where? The cops are bring me back in, I don't know why. Well, shit. If I went abroad, would you go with me? What are you talking about? Suzanne's in the hospital. We need to protect the ZAD, and our community needs us right now. -We can't leave. -Yeah. That's what I figured. What if it's nothing? They might just want to scare you. Maybe, yeah. I'm going to the store to buy food. Okay. Hey, hold on. Can you take him please? So I can go to the meeting with the lawyers at Fosses Bleues. There! See you later. Grégoire? What are you doing here? Can I come in? Oh, you are so cute. You need to bring him back to his mother right away. I know, Mom. She must have called the police and every hospital in France... What do I do? Call her, tell her the child is okay -and go back as soon as possible. -No. I know that. What do I do? What do I... say to my bosses? Think carefully, Grégoire. Think of what you really want. -I have no choice, Mom. -You don't give up on a child. Ever. He's a handsome. He's beautiful. I don't know what to do. You always have the option to quit. That's not an option. There was a guy... He was in the service, he uh... It was two years ago in the Corsicans. He fell in love with an activist. He flipped out, admitted everything, and tried to quit. And? The found his car with the doors open. Nothing else. Police raided the girl's house. They found pipe bombs, wouldn't you know it... though she was a pacifist. Ten years in prison. Take all of it. They grow quickly at this age. Did you call any hospitals? Did you try calling the police? Yeah, yeah. Okay, bye. She never tired calling the police. There were no AMBER alerts. So take the child back and then you leave right away. Hey, Greg. What's happening? What's the matter? Help me, please. What do you want? For me to send a team in? Okay. We'll arrest you there. Now get back. Quickly. And if this continues to get out of hand, I won't be responsible for it. Hakim, yeah. Greg needs to be arrested... Myriam. Myriam, I'm sorry. Don't you ever do that again, do you understand? You can't do that. You just call me. Just send a text. -Send anything. -I told you. I turned everything off, the cops were following me... I don't care about the cops! I don't give a fuck! You text me! I'm sorry. It was a mess, I didn't know how to deal with the... Just a text. I thought something had happened to the two of you. I'm going in. I'm going to... turn myself in. Things will be normal again. You both can have a little break from me. And, maybe you could be right... It might be nothing serious. Let's get out of here. Let's leave, like you wanted. Myriam... I... I'm not good enough for you two. -We don't belong together. -But we do. -We don't. No. -We do! We fully belong with each other! I know we do, what we got, it's rare and precious. Whatever we do, it'll be good. I promise you. Look. What was the first thing we did together? Théo. And he's perfect, isn't he? What could be better than that? What could be better than us? Oh, God. There's cops in the village. Let's go. Greg, let's get out of here. Let's go! Yeah, right away. Bring your papers. -Take your papers! -Yeah. Okay. They're in the ZAD. Fuck... Shit. Shit, Greg, careful. Oh, fuck! -What are you doing? -Come on! Meet me tonight at the abandoned house, okay? -But Greg, shit... -Get there when it's dark. Get out of the car! Get out, let me see your hands. Come on! Get down. Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Greg! Greg! Greg? TWO MONTHS LATER - Hello? - Good morning, sorry to bother you. I'm calling you because I'm looking for a Greg Bernard. He's a roadie, he's lived in Martinique. Sorry, that doesn't ring any bells. You must have the wrong number. - Okay. Thank you, bye. - Bye. - Yes, hello. Hello, Mr. Bernard? - Yes. Sorry to bother you, I'm calling regarding a Greg Bernard. Théo, say hello to Suzanne? Look. "Hello." I wish you could see how much he's grown. He's trying to say hello. It's empty without you here. We're getting off track. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We didn't come here to discuss this. Calm down, please. Legally, work can begin no sooner than 15 days after the order. Exactly, and the order was published yesterday. And know now in 15 days, they'll be here with the machines. So you need to reach out to any of your contacts, the media. Let's get as many people involved as possible. Uh... I don't understand. Didn't we say, "no reporters at meetings"? Don't worry, Myriam. It's fine. -We voted for it at the last meeting. -You're all stupid. Wait. Stay, and let's talk about it. You know you could have stayed and helped us -with this week's organization. -Is the asshole still there. Honestly, read his blog before getting upset. -We need media with us. -You believe that? And you? Looking for every Bernard in France? I'm doing something at least. No, you're not. You're stuck in the past. I'm looking. He said he was done. You saw the letter. It's not normal to break up with a postcard from Martinique. He's in Martinique. So he wrote from Martinique, that's not crazy. You don't break up with your girlfriend and your son through postcard. Girlfriend and his son? Are you hearing yourself? -Since when do you belong to someone? -Stop. It's not like that. Leave me alone. I need to check his criminal record. See what he's really charged with. You're not in his file, so you won't have access. What do you expect to find anyway? And, yeah, his postcard is normal! Stop with the conspiracies. And getting Théo's family records through the mail is normal? The ZAD, the collective, do you even care anymore? You've been doing this for ten years. Ten years. And you're alone. You're sad and alone. So what if I build something else? You're building nothing. You're sulking, you're lost. I don't go to the meetings as much, that's all. You're not taking part in anything. You don't organize anything! The ZAD is falling apart, and you don't care. If you don't care about us anymore then leave, but don't bring us all down with you. You're a pain in the ass. Suzanne... Suzanne was the first one of us. She fought for a new world that she will never see come to pass. She, um... Daughter of a mariner Who sailed across the sea Daughter of a soldier Who hates war Daughter of a convict, escaped criminal Daughter of a king's daughter Too poor for marriage Here. Judge Pringent's office. Would I be able to speak with the judge? Which case is this about? The construction equipment sabotage case. So, uh, I'm really happy. Thank you! Really. And I never could have made it to divisional without the help of my entire team. So, cheers to you. Thank you. Are you okay? How's it going with the Boumedines and the Cherquis? -It could be worse. -That's true. Well, you know, I personally, would always begin with the mosques. Excuse me, sorry. -No, Maynial, not every week! -Come on, please! You help me and I'll leave you alone. If Séverine finds out I've been giving you these, I'm dead, you know that? -Yeah, I know. -Hey, this is the last time. - Hello? - Yes, hello, Mrs. Bernard? Yes? Hello, I'm looking for a Greg Bernard. He's a roadie, he lived in Martinique... There is no Greg Bernard here, I'm sorry... Okay. Thank you very much, bye. - Dr. Deugèse's department? - Hello, ma'am, would it be possible to give the phone to Suzanne Sprauel, please? Yes, just a moment, please. Thank you. You can go ahead. You're on speaker. Suzanne! It happened, he speaks! Do you know what he said first? I said, "Let's eat," and he responded "Let's eat!" His first words. Very pragmatic, food above all else. Well, listen... I hope to bring him by soon. I wish you were here for this. Judge Pringent's office. Yes, hello, would I be able to speak with the judge please? Which case is this about? The construction equipment sabotage case. I was with Greg Bernard. I'm just as guilty. I'd like to be involved in his file. You're requesting an interview with Judge Pringent about the case, right? - Uh-huh. That's right. - Okay. Would next Friday at 11:30 a.m. work or you? Yes. Yes, that works. Okay, I'll write it down. Have a good day. Goodbye. END OF RECORDING Hello? I don't have much time, Myriam. Oh, shit, Greg. Are you okay? Don't turn yourself in. Nothing will change. -All it will do is put you in trouble. -How did you find out? - Where are you at? - I can't tell you that... I'm stuck... Completely. But I'm thinking of you. I saw the tribute to Suzanne on the blog. -I'm always thinking of you. -When are you returning? We need people here. And we need you. And what was with the postcard? - Where are you? - Tell Théo that... What? What should I tell Théo? Greg, you give me strength... Simply hearing your voice... I thought you'd understand. I thought you'd stop waiting. That you'd move on. I miss you. - I miss you a lot. - I miss you, too. Swear to me that you won't go to the judge. -I'm sorry. -Promise me! I can't promise that. I want them to leave you alone. -And I want you to be here with us. -It's too late for that. It's not too late. The trial hasn't even started. Myriam, I'm a cop. No you're not. That's ridiculous. What are you even talking about. If I go to you, they'll destroy you. You need to forget me. Greg, stop. - I have to go right now. - No... I love you both. I love you. -I have to go. -You need to find something else if you really want me to stop what I'm doing. You're the best thing I've known. You're the worst thing I've done. I'm sorry. Leave the premises immediately, we will be using force. Give him to me. Give him to me. You're not complying! You're not complying with the waiting period! Let go of me! Get off! Get off! You are in violation of law! We will press charges! - We will press charges! - Stand back! -You'll be shut down! This is illegal! -Let's go cut them off over there! Yeah! Hey, guys, come on! Hurry! Hurry! Come on, let's move! We're not fighting! You hear that? Bastards! Let's get back! Get out of here you bastards! -ZADs everywhere! -Ewen, we need to go. There's no point staying here. We're not leaving. We'll fuck them up! There's a lot of stuff over here. We need to get over there now. Molotov! Bring them here! Quick! Fire them up! What the fuck, guys? Back, back! We're not afraid. Better leave while you still can. Fuck! Where's the medic? Medic! Medic! Medic! Medic! Medic! Doctors! - Call the doctors! - Are you okay? Are you hurt? You need to go. No, you need to go back right now. There's someone in the tree! Look behind you! Stop it right now! Stop the machine! Shit. Show me. -Shit. -Dammit. Our anger is leading nowhere. All we loved, everything we dreamed of, everything we built... It's not match for their bulldozers. This is useless, it's over. It's over. Don't move. I'll be back. It's nothing. It's okay. Come here, sweetie. Up we go. Come here, sweetheart. Greg? We have a problem, Greg. -What's going on? -Follow me. Wait, until now, she hasn't spoken. She says she will, but I'm pretty sure she wants to talk with me. I can fix it. You won't go anywhere or do anything. Wait, but this is private issue, I can deal with it. A trial will begin, and we have a police officer who involved outside any legal proceedings. If that's proven, the trial will be canceled and the scandal will get the Prime Minister fired, and us with him. So, I'd be curious to know what you think is so private about that. I guarantee it won't come out if we can have 24 hours. Right? We are working to be able to shut her up for a long time. Hold on, please. I'm sure I can diffuse this whole situation. Maynial! You will cancel all your trips and stay here until further notice. All right, talk. What is it? How are you planning to fix things? I'll take you to headquarters, and you'll explain that... you promise you won't say anything. You sign the papers, and they'll calm down. You haven't changed. You were always going to be an obedient and scared little shit. They'll destroy you, Myriam. Really. Tomorrow. And you will lose Théo. Please do what I'm asking. For the both of you. There's something you could do instead. You could call this journalist. Tell him everything on camera, and show your face. And we'll see what would happen for the ZAD, for Théo, for me. Take it, come on. I can't talk with the press. Why not? They'll make me disappear if I do. But Greg, you don't exist. If you did, you would have already done it. You would have done it if you were real. If you really cared for Théo, if you had a bit of courage instead of waiting for everyone else to solve your problems. I know it isn't normal... If you existed, you would have done it. You would've fought for a little bit of the world. You would have done what's right. And you would have felt responsible. But you don't exist. I even have to do this for you. Don't go! Myriam, wait, wait, wait! Myriam, please... Myriam! Don't do this! Théo... Hey. Wait, wait, hold on, Myriam, please! Myriam! Don't go. Let me in. Myriam, please. Hey! Let me in. Open it. He's gotten bigger. He's beautiful. You took me by surprise, Myriam. I'd like to start over with you. We didn't do anything to you. You suddenly came into my life. I was overwhelmed... -and it felt good. -Why would you destroy us, then? I'm going to start over. -It's too late, Greg. -No, no. I'll call the journalist, I promise. Give me his number. Here. I know you'll never call him. You'll keep everything buried, and maybe it's better that way. -No, Myriam, I'll call him. -Then do it. Right now. Do it. I don't know if I'll be able to see you again . Well, I don't want to see you again. And I don't believe a word you say. Say goodbye. This time I want you to say goodbye for good. Now we need you to go. Hello? Hello? This is Grégoire Maynial, I'm a policeman. Come, come! All of you, move forward! Hello, before we begin the replanting ceremony, our defendants would like to tell us something. - No, no, no, no... - Come on! One of you, come on! - Fred! Fred! - So... I just received confirmation from our lawyers, the trial has been canceled! The whole trial won't go forward! Monday, you destruct Monday, you break down Tuesday, we build back up... Come over here, kids. Tuesday, we build back up... So these are announcements for our trees, later we're gonna go plant trees all over. -Friday, the drilling rig! -Friday, the drilling rig! -Saturday, death to pigs! -Saturday, death to pigs! Sunday, you turn and walk away The divers found nothing. Request to continue the search? - End of search? - End of search. Okay, Christophe. You can come back. Received, end of search. THREE YEARS LATER Did you hear? Théo, did you hear? Yes. Okay, you can open your eyes... slowly. What was it? A bird. Yes, good, a bird. A nightingale. Listen... It's because we fought against the construction of a parking lot, that you can still hear nightingales singing. Okay, it's snack time. Are you hungry? - Yes. - Yes. Good morning. -Good morning. -How are you? - Fine. - Do you like it? - Oh, right. - Here. Hey, Mara! How are you? Hi, Théo. A PLACE TO FIGHT FOR
