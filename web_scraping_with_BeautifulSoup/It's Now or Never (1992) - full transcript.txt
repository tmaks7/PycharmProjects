api.OpenSubtitles.org is deprecated, please implement REST API from OpenSubtitles.com You look very beautiful tonight. Would you care to dance with me? —Coke, please. —Thirty cents for Coke. Elvis likes to drink coke. We're sharing a bottle? It's not enough! You're so stingy! It's more romantic this way, right? That slut is really something. She managed to seduce Tai Chi Kei so easily. Look at them, they are dancing so intimately. She snatched away three of Siu Long Pau's boyfriends. Siu Long Pau was so mad at her. Well, of course. Siu Long Pau trashed her... and said that she slept with at least seven thousand men. Hold on. Promise me that you won't see Siu Long Pau again. All right, I swear to heaven that if I see Siu Long Pau again, I'll... my head will be bashed with a chair by a woman. Lottery! The prize is one million dollars! Hurry! Come and get a lottery ticket. I'm betting two dollars on horse number three. Buy a pack of Fortune cigarette... you'll get fortunate... Hey, cigarette girl! Give me a pack of cigarette! I want to buy a pack of cigarette! A cigarette girl nowadays is more snobbish than Fung Ying Fan. She knows that you're going to take advantage of her. Hey, you better be careful, don't get into trouble for that. You don't have to worry about that. It's really a waste for this girl to be a cigarette girl. She's more suitable to take part in a beauty pageant. I disagree. She should be a strip dancer instead! I want to see her naked! —I'm sure she has a nice figure! —Let's drink... Uncle, your mouth is so filthy. She's even better! I think those are size 38! Miss, may I measure them with my hands? I'll buy two packs of cigarette from you. Sure. I accept it on her behalf, but there's one condition. —I'm so lucky today! —You're in luck... Give me this! Gargle your mouth first! Hey... over there. The company paid that old man three hundred dollars... so that you wouldn't be hauled to the police station. You better learn your lesson. You paid the compensation for the sake of the company's image, not for us. We are here to sell cigarette, not our dignity! That old man has a filthy mouth! I was just helping him to gargle it! Yes, we were just helping him to clean his throat. Hey! Come over here! Hurry up! Are you here to smoke or to sell cigarette? If the manager didn't insist that you'd be an attraction... I'd have fired all of you right from the beginning! You can work as roadside prostitutes instead! Your mouth is as filthy as that old man's mouth. We caught them in action! Hurry up and go! —Hurry up! —Yes, hurry up and go! That slut really snatched Tai Chi Kei away! Let's go! Stop right there! Where are you going? You're working now. I forbid you to leave! Darn you, you horse-faced cow! You're always bossing us around. How dare you! I'll teach you a lesson! —Are you looking for a fight? —Yes, so what? Before I fight with you, let me warn you first. I'm the descendant of the Royal Eagle Claw and the Springing Kick. I started to learn kung fu when I was just three years old. If you were hit by my claws... you'll suffer from internal injury, vomit blood... and your limbs will be crippled. You might even die instantly. If you don't kowtow and apologise now... be prepared for the dire consequences! Are you really that powerful? —We'll see about that. —Thank you... If I used my Eagle Claw just now, her arm would be crippled. You only know how to boast. Why didn't you use it just now? It slipped my mind because it was so chaotic. Hey! Wait for me. —Hey, what bag is that? —Your scrotum. —Her mouth is so filthy. —That's right. Your mouth is more filthy because it has venereal disease. This is what we use to earn a living, specky boy. You tramp! How dare you seduce my boyfriend! I'll teach you a lesson with my kung fu! Go to hell! Don't move! They are fighting. —Should we stop them? —Are you stupid? I've seen a lot of fights. But this fight is going to be more entertaining than those in Kowloon City. Pretending to be dead? Get up! Go to hell! You tramp! Go to hell! Stop right there! —Help! —Trying to run away? —You slut! —Help! Help! You evil slut! Go to hell! Help! Go to hell! —Go to hell! —Go to hell! I'll show you my Eagle Claw! Don't force me to use my kung fu! I shouldn't have sworn that. I'm going to beat your breasts until they burst! You tramp! How dare you beat my breasts! It's my turn now! —I'm going to burst them! —No! I'm going to burst them! Stop! They're really going to burst! How dare you! I'll kill you. Help...! Stop it! Or I'll shoot! Don't move! Squat down! Faster! —Don't run! —Let go of me! What do you want? You're a thief! Don't touch me! I can sue you for molesting me! —What is this? —You darn fat woman! Yes, I did take your things. So what? I don't want them anymore! They aren't that great. You can have them back! —Why did you push me? —So what if I push you? —You're a thief... —Come on, arrest me... —It's time to let us go. —We've to catch the last ferry. I can't forget... I can't forget your goodness... —Stop singing! —Is it a crime for me to sing? Do you believe in genetics? The two of them... one was caught for assault, and the other was caught for thievery. They were brought in at almost the same time. Oh, my god! So you're siblings? What a shame! Shouldn't a family like this be annihilated? Of course it's about genetics. Your dad and uncle are high-ranking police officers like you too. —They don't look like sisters. —Shut up! Well, anything can happen in a family like this. A year or two from now, let's see who'll end up as a prostitute... and who'll be locked up behind bars. By then, they'll know who their real mother is. Are you done talking? What's wrong with you? When did I offend you? —Be quiet. Sit down. —She's insulting our family! —I'm so mad! I want to hit her! —Keep quiet! You can't offend someone like her. She is from a police family. So what? What's so great about the police? Come on, hit me or shoot me. Do you know who her ancestors were? How would I know if it's the Monkey God or Pigsy? You are uneducated, so you don't know anything. The police are very good at asking people for bribe money. In other words, they're beggars. So her ancestors were members of the Beggars' Sect. —Her whole family are beggars! —Beggars! Did you hear that? You're a beggar! They are crazy... She's a beggar... —What did you say? —What do you want? —This policewoman has gone mad! —Let go of me! —Give me the gun! —No! —Come on! —Let go of me! —Stop it! —They're creating trouble. Let go of me! This is the headquarters of the Beggars' Sect, right? Tell your chief, Hong Qigong, to come out and see me! —Let go of me! —Madam, calm down. —Don't hold her back! —Go and beg elsewhere! What a crazy woman! —What are you laughing at? —Do you think this is a market? I just got back from Saliman. There're so many lost girls there. Hey, 1247. There are so many lost girls, and all of them are beautiful. There are even blonds! I slept with one last night. Hi, Sir Zhou. But frankly speaking, it was just all right. After the session, it was no good... Both of you are here? —What a coincidence! —Who got arrested this time? Both of them were arrested for different crimes. What a shameful family. —Hey, who are you? —Their dad! Mr Policeman... I don't feel well. Can you feel that my hands are cold? Mr Policeman, are you done with the statement yet? I want to sleep. Please sign here. Miss Siu Long Pau, if you want to sleep, please go home and sleep. Look at the two of you! Why couldn't you keep out of trouble? When you were still a baby, your mom left the two of you with me. I shoulder the responsibility of being the dad and the mom. I couldn't sleep well every night because I've to change diapers for you. Until now, I still have to worry about you catching a cold on rainy nights. I'm not expecting them to repay me in the future. I'm just hoping that they can study and work hard... so that the family won't starve and we can live peacefully. But the two of them disappointed me! The younger one is always playing truant and looking for a fight... and the elder one keeps switching jobs. You keep getting into fights and you just want to be a gangster. I nag at you for hours every night before I let you go to bed. If you did something bad, it's daddy's fault. Even when I keep you on a tight leash, you're still getting into trouble. You should know how difficult it is for me to earn an income. I earned every single cent with my sweat and sperm. Dad, I know I'm wrong. I'll mend my ways. —It's my job as a father to raise you. —Don't say anymore... I will study hard and I won't get into trouble again. —Good girl... —Don't cry anymore... —What's wrong with you? —Stop it, the two of you! —Look, dad is crying! —I'm warning the two of you! Stop pretending to be a good father and a filial daughter here. It makes me want to puke! How could you say that? Are you a human? —My dad is very noble. —No, I'm not. It's important for a person... to have a sense of propriety, justice, integrity and honour. Hai Wong Tat! Who is Hai Wong Tat? —It's me, sir! —Come here. —You're such a despicable man. —What is it? You molested a sixty years old grandmother? —I'm innocent! I didn't molest her! —Go down! Move! I was only teasing her, sir. —Nobody would believe that. —Just go down with me. Why would I molest a short, fat and ugly old woman? Sir, look, I'm such a handsome man. It's not difficult for me to find a woman. —Are you done with your questions? —Almost. What is the occupation of your father? He sees himself as a casanova. To put it nicely, he's an old gigolo. To put it crudely, he's a male prostitute. Your family is complicated. You're a smart girl. Why don't you get a serious job? You should think about your future. Are you going to be a gangster until you're seventy years old? You don't seem to be taking a statement. No, let's just treat this as a chat between friends. Are you dragged into this because of a gangster boyfriend? Don't do it. Don't get involved with a rich guy too. Because most of them are heartless. You should get to know an honest and hardworking man. Although you'll not be very rich... but you'll eventually have a house, children and a car. It's quite a good life, right? What's your phone number? —Can I ask you out for a meal? —What are you talking about? I want you to treat me to a meal. Hey! Ah Sing is trying to pick up this gangster girl! —What? Really? —How could he do that? Kiddo, I might consider it in your next life! Go to hell! Get out of my way! According to the sergeant, he handled several cases... where the whole family was arrested for the same offence. However, the whole family committing different offences... Hi! and yet arrested on the same day, this is the first time he encountered it. —So what? —Yes, so what? It means that I'm great. They told me to go on stage to receive a prize. Each of them hit my chest three times. My chest is all bruised now. I'm sorry, dad. I swear that I'll mend my ways. Mend your ways? You never take your oath seriously. —I will really study hard. —Give me three sticks of sugarcane. You always like to lie. —I inherited that from you. —Well, that's true. —Here, take one to chew... —Give me one too. Why couldn't you steal tomorrow? Why must you embarrass me tonight? Why couldn't you molest her tomorrow? Why must you do it tonight? How dare you talk back! Did I molest you? —Molest me? That's incest! —I'm going to hit you. —You wouldn't dare! —I'll show you! —Honey, are you done with the bath? —Darling, are you ready yet? Baby, I'm ready! I'm out. Didn't you say that you're ready? Have you taken the pill and rubbed the oil yet? I want to... I want to create a romantic atmosphere first... Do you think we're still young? Why do you want to do such a childish thing? Let's not waste time. Let's just do it. —Let's do it then! —Let's go! —Let's go! —Let's go... He must be here. Gentler, please. Go easy on me. Gentler! You're killing me. No! That feels so good! No... Wait, I think someone came into the room. Wait, someone really came into the room. —Stop! —You can't stop now! —Come out! —What are you doing? We can talk things over. What do you want? Brother Wah, why are you so free to come here today? How dare you speak to me with that kind of attitude? Including interest, you owe me 766 dollars. And you owe Siu Lai four months of rental. You better pay up now. If you don't pay up now... I'll cut three inches of flesh off your body. Can you guess which part of your body will I cut? Brother Wah, does it really have to be three inches? Of course! I'm going to cut it and soak it in wine. No! You can't cut this part... —Why not? —You can't... Other people use it to have fun. I use mine to make a living. It's a rule that you can't cut off the source of income of a person. So please don't do it, Brother Wah. Please give me another chance. Remove his pants! Siu Lai... on account that I used to serve and satisfy your needs... could you please ask Brother Wah to let me go? You're so heartless. You only know how to talk. You stood me up for three times already. You didn't pay the rent and you didn't provide service to me. No... I wouldn't dare. I'll provide service to you in the future. —Please help me... —How much does he owe? Honey, it's just a little money. It's only 760 dollars. —Let me pay. —Honey! You really love me. —You're indeed my bosom friend. —Of course. Hai Wong Tat, you're really something. So you've found a new woman to depend on. Hold on! You could go to bed with this woman who looks like a vampire? This is so humiliating to me! —I'm so angry... I'm leaving now... —Don't be jealous... —You broke my heart! —I really love you deeply. Please don't go, honey... Tramp, who do you think you are? Do you think you're very beautiful? Take a look at yourself, you look like a pig. If you're beautiful, you wouldn't be paying for his service. —Shameless tramp, get lost! —Honey, I sincerely love you... Brothers... Siu Lai, let's get onto the bed now. —Hurry up! —I won't use your service again! Darn gangster girls! Get out of my way! Darn fatty, be careful I'll cut your snout off! Let's go up and see what's going on. Brother Wah... Pa! Let go of me... Hai Wong Tat, you're really something. Where did you get such beautiful clients? —No, they are my daughters. —You have such beautiful daughters? Yes, they look like me. You don't have to worry about your debt then. Let them become prostitutes. I'm sure they will be very popular. —I'm going to chop you to death! —Don't act rashly! —I'm going to chop them to death! —Calm down! —It's not the time to do it yet! —Move aside! She's such a fiery temper. I like it. Siu Lai... please give me another chance. I promise I'll provide the best service to you in the future. —Are you sure you can do that? —Sure... there's a new pill now. —After taking it, I can last very long! —You're so naughty... Try it if you don't believe me! —Don't try anything funny! —Get out of the way! —What do you want? Move! —What are you pointing at? What? What do you want? Everything's fine now. Siu Lai promised to try my service. I'll come and collect the rest of the money in two days. Count yourself lucky today. It's pretty firm. —Let go of me! —That's all. Darn you! Go and poke your mom instead! Let's have a drink tonight and we'll get naked in my bath tub, okay? Hey, I just know you for a day and you want to bath together with me? Don't try to take advantage of me. I know kung fu. Are you talking about your kung fu on bed? Don't look at me like that. Your eyes are so seductive. Why did you take my picture? Because you're beautiful. I'm an award-winning photographer. Sir, how about buying a bottle of shaving cream? Sorry, I don't have moustache. How about buying a bottle of perfume for your girlfriend? —I don't have a girlfriend. —Really? Hey, are the two of you working or flirting? Let's meet at the pub tonight. —Okay? Bye. —Okay. Bye. This is my phone number. Don't forget to give me a call. Okay. —Bye... —Bye... Hey, what's wrong with you? That guy looks like a moron and you gave him your phone number? Because he's rich! His pair of shoes is worth more than a thousand dollars! His camera is branded and is worth about seven thousand dollars! On top of that, his watch is a Vacheron Constantin watch... which is worth more than ten thousand dollars! So of course I'm hitting on him. Your eyes are so sharp. It's a waste that you're not a thief. I've been thinking about it for a few nights. There are three ways to get rich. The first way is to be born rich. The second way is to earn it yourself. The third way is to marry a rich guy. We were not born in a rich family. And it's too tough to earn it yourself. So the fastest way is to marry a rich guy, do you understand? You're right! It's best if he's rich, handsome, gentle, romantic and loyal. Sure, if you're as beautiful as Marilyn Monroe... or as rich as Sally Aw Sian. Unfortunately, you're not. You can choose to go to the staff lounge or go outside. —What's wrong? —We are working now. —What's the matter? —We're the police. There were several cases of gangster girls... stealing things and fighting in this area last night. I need to question them. Your two employees are not decent girls. She's the leader of her group of gangster girls. Her nickname is Crazy Chick. She has three records of assault. She was in a female reform school eight years ago. This one has a more colourful history. Her nickname is Siu Long Pau... and she's also known as Flirty Pau. She has records of assault, theft and possession of illegal substance. Their files at the police station are at least a foot thick. They are really the worst dregs of society. I've already said that they are not decent girls. —That's right... —You can't judge a book by its cover. Boss, you better check your goods and your cash in your shop. Yes... thank you. Fine, you win. But you better watch out. Yes, I'm so scared. You don't have a choice now. Go outside! Stand with your feet apart! There's nothing to see here. Stop crowding around... —Why did you take my handbag? —What are you looking at? Go look at her panties instead! You better watch out. They look more like drug dealers than thieves. They look like drug addicts. —Wonderful... —What a sight... Come and have a look at the eighth wonder of the world! A jumping Mount Everest! Only ten dollars... Hey handsome, it's only ten dollars. You can view the sample there. They are not old hags. They are all beautiful girls. It's definitely worth it, sir. Go over there and have a look at the sample to see what we're offering. Come on, go there and have a look... Hey, it's time! It's your turn to jump now. There's no need to jump anymore! Let's go now! What? When it's your turn to jump, you're calling it a day. —Hurry up and get into the lorry. —Okay... This is a residential area, so don't make so much noise. Look up there. —Hurry up, get in... —Hurry up... Don't make any noise. Hurry up... Hurry up! Don't walk so slowly. There are so many people! We're rich this time! Don't stop! Hurry up! There are so many lechers in this world. A bottle of soft drink each. Don't fight over it. Drink slowly. Be quiet, don't make any noise. Just take the drink first. Why is it taking so long? When can we get to see it? Be patient, everyone. There will be lighting effects later. The first scene is about to start. She and I will perform... in the second and third scenes. So be patient and wait. Why is it taking so long? Yes, she's quite pretty, but her waist is a bit big. —And the breasts are a bit small. —But she's quite fair. Why are you covering yourself with the towel? Remove it... Don't try anything funny! I'm a cop! So what? You still have to remove the towel! Yes, let's remove her towel! Where is she going? She's running all over the place! It's so interesting! First is the towel and now it's the curtain! Don't come any closer... Pull the curtain away! I've taken her towel as a memento! Get lost! Don't come any closer! Or I'll shoot! Get out! It's just a toy gun! She uses it to masturbate! I've seen it in many Japanese porn magazines. —I'm so smart. —Is she going to perform it for us? It's best if it's a water pistol with water inside! Come on, do it! —I'm really going to shoot! —Shoot... I'm going to shoot! Don't move! Put the gun down! —Don't move! Everybody, don't move! —Stand aside! —Senior, I'm a cop. —Yes, I know our pay is low. But you should spend more time on collecting protection money... instead of being involved in a sex show. How could you degrade yourself to that? You're a disgrace to the police! She's a cop? I've already suspected that she's a prostitute. So she's a police prostitute. Hurry up! Get in! —Move! —Hurry up! Why did you ask me to call 999? It was so vicious to do that. Hey, you came up with that idea. You're always doing such evil things... be careful of retribution! Hey, Sis, how did you convince that cop... to give you the address and phone number of that female cop? I told him I want to apologise to the female cop... but I'm too embarrassed to do it at the police station. He's such a stupid cop! With your talent, you could easily take advantage of him! You're always swearing, I won't take you to see my boyfriend. I'm a nice and innocent girl when I'm with him. Stop lying! He's not called Big Mouth Joe for no reason! Chui, Chu is taking over your pill business. —Really? —Yes. Get out of my way. She's our leader. If you want to get some pills, you can buy from her. I've a strong backing. I'll keep the price constant. And I've ample stock. You can get how much you want. That Liar Chui is trying to set up a pill business? Her price is so expensive... and her stock is limited. She can go and eat faeces instead. Take her to get the pills. How dare you! Darn you! Go to hell! I'll show you who's the boss! You told me to eat faeces? Who's eating it now? Wong Yau Chui, stop it immediately! What's wrong? She said that her back hurts, so I'm giving her a massage. —Stop it! —Help... —Get out of my way! —You gave me a fright! Goddess of Mercy, if I, Wong Yau Chui, still don't repent... if I don't stop smoking, drinking, swearing, gambling... having fun, flirting with guys and lying... then let me be hit by a car. —Shut up! —What is it? Are you crazy? Why are you saying such things in front of the goddess? It might come true! You better be careful! I'm very serious now. Why can't you believe me? I'm serious! —Darn girl... —I really want to mend my ways. —Stop talking nonsense. —Why can't you believe me? Yes, you're a clever girl. There are ten secondary schools here. You will never be able to get into the top six schools. And the four remaining schools have all kicked you out. Great! You don't have to go to school anymore. You can now concentrate on flirting with guys. —That's great! —You're so clever now! You're selling pills now! You're still on bail for the previous case. Great! You're going to prison now! Once you're out, go and be a prostitute, all right? Great! A prostitute can earn a lot of money! —You're brainless. —I'm going to be rich! —You can be a brainless prostitute. —Yes, I'm brainless just like you. What a terrible daughter! —You're selling pills? —I'm not as terrible as you. —Hey! Don't touch my stuff! —Come on, finish them. —Let me feed them to you. —Give it back to me! Come on, swallow all the pills. Then you can have a good sleep. When you wake up, you can start prostituting, okay? —Sure, just like what you always do. —Yes... you're brainless. —Where can I find such a good job? —I worked so hard to raise you. —Go and eat faeces! —If I'm bad, then you're worse. —You're terrible! —Go and eat faeces... Go and eat faeces... —Stop hitting me! —Moron! —If you hit again, I will fight back! —You dare to fight back? —Do you think I don't dare? —I'm your dad! —That's enough! —Let me show you... —What a useless kid! —I'm your kid. Darn it! You ruined all my pills! I wonder who's the one who often picks up ugly women. Not me. I wonder who's the one who lives off women. Not me either. I wonder who is called Hai Wong Tat. Hai Wong Tat is your dad. My classmates asked me if our family is running a Chinese medicine shop. What Chinese medicine shop? They asked me why there are so many Chinese medicine in our house. I didn't know how to answer them at first. But I know what's going on now. Look here. —Hey! —Look at these things here. This jar contains tiger penis. Stop that! Don't touch my things! I'm going to get angry! You need to eat tiger penis to help you perform. —Put them back! —And there's India magic oil too. —Sheep eyelashes! —Put them back! You darn girl! —Put them back. They're expensive! —And Spanish flies too! —My pills are expensive too! —How dare you! You darn girl! —How dare you too! —You darn girl! —I'm going to hit you! —Aphrodisiac wine! —How dare you touch my things! —That's enough! —Darn you! Who do you think you are? —How dare you hit your dad! —I'll knock some sense into you! —Go ahead and try! —Throw it! —Don't do it. Do you think you're very great now? You're really crazy. Don't say anymore! Get into the room! She'll really beat you to death! —Get lost! —Why did you hit dad? I was just helping you! I was the one fighting with him. What's it got to do with you? —Why did you interfere? Tramp! —I like it, so what? Stop fighting. Come on, try my dish... Hey! What are you all discussing about so loud and jovially? Hey! What are you doing? What's our fighting got to do with you? You only know how to flirt with men! And you're a hopeless romantic! When you see a handsome man, you'll lose your wits. Your Peter is not a good man. He's a gangster. I've told you many times but you just wouldn't listen. You're just waiting to be sold to the brothel by him. That's enough! I was just trying to end your fight but you scolded me instead? Let me warn you that I know kung fu! Let me remind you, I started to learn kung fu when I was three! Don't do it, Siu Long Pau! Ying is our friend. Please don't use such cruel techniques on her. You have your brain on your breasts! —Really? —You can't see through her lie? Her kung fu is only for posing and boasting. She totally can't fight at all. I can win you with just one hand. You're a coward and you're clumsy. You only know how to talk but you can't fight for nuts. You were badly beaten by a seventy-pound girl last week. That was so shameful and embarrassing. Don't fight anymore. Don't think that just because you're my friend, you can mess with me! Sure, I won't mess with you. Let the horny men mess with you. They can mess with you however they like and you'll still be happy. —Shameless! —You're more shameless than me! You started sleeping with men at the age of thirteen. You've no right to say I'm shameless! Darn you! That's enough. Stop airing each other's dirty laundry. Both of you are equally bad. Ah Mui, Ah Heung, was I your enemy in my previous life? Why did you leave these two bad and ungrateful daughters to me? Now that they are all grown up, they even beat their father! They hit me just now! Did you see it? Hey! Are you using mom to threaten me? —That's enough! —Let go of me... They are hopeless. I'll get into trouble if I stick with them. What's the use of being beautiful? I must not go up! I must be sensible! —I'm not going up. —Ungrateful daughter! —What do you want now? —Come on, hit me! —Don't stop me! Move aside! —Calm down... I'm no longer your friend! I'm leaving now! This is all your fault! No, it's her fault! It's your fault! Siu Long Pau! Get out of the way! Siu Long Pau is back. It's disheartening to be your friend. —Rose. —Why are you here? I'm free and I'm passing by... so I just want to talk to you. Here's something for you. But I don't have anything to say to you. It's Golden Cup chocolate. He knows what he's doing. Why do you keep pushing my hand away? My family is poor, so I'm keeping it as a dowry. There are not many girls who have principles like you nowadays. Hold on. Are you sincere with me? Of course I'm sincere. I want to make you my wife. After we are married, where would we live? I will buy a house, and the two of us can live there. Hold on, draw our house first. All right. Wow, it's a bungalow. I want a bungalow with a swimming pool, draw it. I've to give birth to a baby? That's too fast! Do you think I'm a sow? What do you want then? Apart from the swimming pool, I want a tennis court too. —A Mercedes-Benz too. —I want jewellery too. You're so fussy. Well, a woman needs jewellery as guarantee. You've to sign it too. Are you satisfied now? May I kiss you now? You can touch me, but that's it, all right? I know. Hey, why aren't you drinking? Come on, let's continue to drink. I wish you success in catching the big fish! —Let's drink to the last drop. —Thank you. Let me teach you something. Men are like eagles... whenever they are hungry, they'll be hovering above us. They wouldn't leave even if we try to chase them away. But once they're full... they'll fly away and vanish. Do you understand? I don't know why, but when a handsome man touches me... my whole body will start to feel weak. What? You're so useless. Hold on. Just a minute! —Give me some beer to take this pill. —What's the matter? Taking a break for the first half. Move your legs! You couldn't maintain it, right? Both of you are so obedient today, you didn't go out to have fun. Move your leg away! I'll let you have a taste of mine! It's none of your business. Sis has been waiting for her boyfriend to call for the whole night. Ying, so you've caught the big fish? —Hai Wong Tat, are you ready yet? —Go to hell! I'm coming... I'm waiting for the effect of the pill to kick in. —She's calling you. Hurry up... —I'm going to do my job now. I'm taking my gun with me to the battlefield now... Dad, try not to humiliate yourself anymore. That's right. Come on, let's drink. Cheers! He's calling... Hello? I've waited for you for so long. Why are you only calling me now? —That's so mushy. —Something terrible has happened! Siu Long Pau has been sold to the brothel! What's the matter? What's the matter? Dad! Siu Long Pau has been sold to the brothel. We are going to rescue her now. Help me to send my regards to her. —Didn't you say you could do it? —I was able to just now. —Why can't you do it now? —Let's do it again then. Slowly. Slow down! Stop pulling it. That won't help. That's a turn-off. You're going to get it from me! Hello? It's the detention room. Ching Tau Sing, your dream gangster girl is looking for you! Hey, face the reality and answer the phone. Hello? What a moron! What a fool! She's making use of him again. Yes, he's definitely a fool. Hi, how are you? You deserved to be slapped! You're useless! You know she's using you, yet you still agreed. Everyone knows your secret now! Serves you right! Sir, you're alone? Come on, sit here... Be careful. It's a bit dark here. Be careful, don't stumble. This way... This seat is excellent! Over here... be careful. Sir, do you know any of the girls? Why don't you do the introduction? Sure. I can guarantee that you'll come back after trying our girls. What type of girls do you like? We've young girls, flirty girls, plump girls and slim girls. I like foreign girls because they're tall. I want a Shanghai girl with fair and smooth skin. She must not be too fluent in Cantonese and she must have an accent. And she must be able to moan in bed. Sir, you really know how to enjoy life. A Shanghai girl is indeed better in bed. Coincidentally, we have a new Shanghai girl. Sir, have a seat first... Sir, the girl is here. Mingyue, this man wants to sleep with you. Sir, are you kidding? How can we sleep out here? —Take this money. —Thank you... I want to have a big room. Sir, please. —Have fun! —Okay... Ying asked me to come and save you. Let's go now. Save me? Why do you want to save me? I'm working here voluntarily. It's easy to make money here, and the job is easy. Letting them touch me... and giving them hand jobs... can make me more than 3,000 dollars a month. It pays 700 times more than the average jobs. Peter didn't force you to do this? He has a problem, so I'm helping him to get some money. But I'm doing this voluntarily. I really love him. I'm willing to do anything for him. Don't interfere in our affairs! Since you like to be a prostitute so much... all right then, I'm taking my leave now. I'll tell Ying not to bother about you again. What's the matter? Tell me now. I promised to pay for Peter's debt. So they're holding me here now. Please get me out of here. There are all types of perverted customers here. I really can't stand it anymore. Don't be afraid. What a relief. Sir, you can't take her out. Go pick another girl. I'm not taking her out, I'm taking her home. What's the matter? What are you all doing here? Did Kin ask you to come here and create trouble? Hey, brothers! There are troublemakers here! Hurry up! Come and deal with them! —I'm a cop! —So what if you're a cop? —We've paid the bribe. —Don't move! If you continue to make trouble here, I'm calling Master Ngan. Yes, you've paid, so you can do your business. But you cannot force someone to become a prostitute, right? Siu Long Pau. If you leave just like this, they are going to hurt me. I still love you very much. Come back to me. You still want to go back to him? Wake up, Siu Long Pau! How could you forget about it? I know you love me very much. How could you bear to leave me? Come here... good girl. Come back to me. I love you so much. Come here... Come here. I did love you very much in the beginning. Eagle claw! Springing Kick! You hurt me so badly, now I'm going to make you pay! Fantastic! —Siu Long Pau, let's go now! —Am I very powerful? Don't move! Get in! Pay up please. Thank you... Pay up please. Thank you. Go away! It's so old-fashioned and mushy! —Pay up please... —Why don't you go to hell? Why should I pay up? I haven't finished watching it yet. Get lost! Everybody else paid up except you. —Who do you think you are? —What's the problem? Darn you! You're really troublesome. What's up? I don't really know you. What's the matter? Go out! What's the matter? I don't want to go! Why are you dragging me into the car? I'm not getting in! —Get in! —Let go of me! They are going to rape me! They are holding me as a hostage! —Move! —You don't have to be so rough. Brother Sing. Have a seat first. Please hold on. He's still stepping into it despite knowing that it's a trap. Since the beginning of time, beautiful women brought bad luck. —A hero can't escape from a woman. —Let's go into the room. It's so noisy here. There was once a king called King Zhou. —He was strong and valiant. —Please sit. But alas, he met the evil Daji. As a result, he lost both his kingdom and his life. What brings you here to see me? Sing, I think that you look good in this outfit. You're getting more handsome. I've realised that you're actually very cute. You're cute, innocent and you've a baby face. I want to hug you, kiss you, and to take good care of you. Are you trying to seduce me? Are you in serious trouble? I'll repay you for your help. Do you want to have fun with me? —What are you waiting for? —What am I waiting for? Am I waiting for something? I'm not waiting for anything, right? Don't be silly. You keep pacing up and down in front of me, you're giving me a headache. —I'm sorry. —Do you want to have a shower first? —I already did. —I'm going to shower then. Wait for me on the bed. Rose... you do understand, right? I'm not the type of guy who takes advantage of a girl when she's in trouble. You know that, right? I feel as if I'm raping... forcing you... I think it's not fair to you. I don't feel it that way. You're going to risk your life in order to save my sister. So I should repay you for that. Come on. Your hands are so cold. You're not passionate at all. Is it because you don't want to do it with me? I thought that you like me very much. —Are you looking down on me? —Hey, you shouldn't say that. You know that I like you very much. So of course I want to do it with you. When I fantasise about it sometimes... I'll feel dizzy as if I'm in a dream. You're not dreaming now. In a short while, you can do what you've always wanted to do. I want to ask a question and you must answer me. Are you a virgin? Look, if you are a virgin, I can't take away your virginity. Hey, are you out of your mind? Do you know what century is it now? Do I have to preserve my hymen to wrap wonton? Why did you ask such a stupid question? To wrap wonton... Don't tell me you're a virgin? Don't lie to me! Tell me! I want to know the truth! —Come on, tell me... are you? —I don't know. How could you not know? Either you are or you are not. You can't lie about it. —Come on, tell me... are you? —Would masturbating count? Open the door... Oh no! There's a raid! I'm dead... I'd be in trouble if they see me here. I won't die if I jump down from the third floor, right? What's the matter with you? Hey, don't be so scared. It's just a husband catching his adulterous wife in the room next door. I want to ask you something. You really haven't tried it before? I want to save it for my marriage. You're really as cute as a baby sometimes. Really? Even if it's not for my sister... I'd still want to be with you. Is that all you're going to do? Switch off the light first, then we kiss again. Mom... Mom... Mom... Mommy... —Call me sister first. —Sister... Good boy. If I'd known you were a virgin, I'd have done it slowly. If I'd known you were so impatient, I'd have taken off my panties first. Well, even though they held me captive for two days... but they didn't manage to take advantage of me! I spat at whoever dared to come near me. Brother Sing, do you know how brave and cool you were just now? You pointed the gun at them and forced them to let me go. When I was walking out, I saw their leader, Fat Chat, was spitting mad! Fantastic! You were so cool! It's so painful... Hey, stupid girl, you really don't know what's going on? That Fat Chat is a good buddy of Ngan. If we knew that Ngan was involved, we wouldn't have gone to rescue you. What's so great about Ngan? Fat Chat is just a buddy of Ngan. Why should we be afraid of him? You're wrong to say that, Chui. That Fatty Chu is under Fat Chat. You beat her up for no reason and took away her pills. No matter how you explain it, you're definitely at fault. Sha, I didn't know that this matter is so serious. I'm really sorry. Since we're colleagues, it's fine. I'm sorry... Salaam... You're out of your mind. Hey, Chui, Ah Sing did this for your sister. Your sister should know what to do. —I know. —Get down now. —Sis! —How are you? Are you okay? I'm fine, I just have some bruises. It's nothing. They tied me up at first, so I had to urinate and defecate on the chair. They were afraid of the smell, so I was allowed to move around. —Where's dad? —Where's Ah Sing? —Please take a look. —That's all. Thank you. Does anyone want some alcohol or soft drinks? —Give us some tea then. —Smoothie for me please, thank you. Sure. Get him a glass of smoothie. Thank you. My daughter is not very well-educated. I was busy earning a living, so I didn't teach her well. But luckily, she is naturally a good girl. She's a quiet girl, so she doesn't like to go out with her friends. She likes to stay in her room to read books. I always tell her that since she's still young... she should go out more and make more new friends. But she just wouldn't listen to me. It's so infuriating! No, that's a good thing. It's hard to find girls like her nowadays. To be frank, I'm a widow and he's my only son... so I'm hoping to have grandchildren soon. —But the world has changed now. —Thank you... Our children are all adults now. I'll let Ray make his own decision. Hey! No! Give it back to me... You're so naughty. Hey, what's so interesting? Let me have a look! Come on! —Give it back to me, Liar Chui! —What's this? —I'm getting angry. —Why is it curly and long? Is this an elephant trunk? But why is it so thin and curly? Stop it! What's so fun? Stop playing! You're embarrassing me. I'm sorry. Actually, our two families share the same fate. My wife died many years ago. I sleep alone every night. There are times when I feel so empty and lonely... when there's no one around in the middle of the night. I need someone to comfort me. At times like this, if there's someone who can make you happy... and have fun with you, it'd be great, wouldn't it? I'm sorry, I'm too direct. Dad, are you all right? Drink slowly. Be careful of choking. Hey, open the door first. Dad, open the door. —Hey, open the door. —What's the matter? Dad's clients complained that he's expensive and he couldn't perform. What couldn't perform? Of course it's his tool. You're so stupid to ask that. He said that his life is ruined now. He's threatening to commit suicide. What should we do? This has happened so many times before. What's there to worry about? Really? Then I won't bother about him anymore. Let him be. I, Hai Wong Tat, have been nothing but... dedicated to my work for 30 years. I gave it my all every single night. I've accomplished nothing so far... but that's because I lack luck. I didn't give up... as long as I was still in the game. But never did I imagine I'd become... impotent. At first, the clients said... they didn't get any satisfaction. Now, they said I couldn't perform at all! Initially, I thought I couldn't perform... as the clients were too ugly. So I took viagra and rested for a week. Then I went to Pimp Tak to look for... a pretty young girl... but it happened again. I just couldn't do it. My career is finished. Fate is a cruel mistress. Before I'm able to win the battle... my horse died. It made a hero like me... to weep bitterly. Darn you! You humiliated me! Fine! I'll cut you away! Dad, what are you doing? Let go of the knife! Dad, did you forget to take your medicine again? Why did you do that? Why did you burn my hand with your cigarette? Dad, what are you trying to do? —Do you have to do that? —You'll be fine after a rest. At worst, I'll study hard and work at night to earn money to support you. Why are you always saying such nonsense? What do you expect me to say then? At least it sounds nicer this way. —Get lost! Leave me alone! —Don't you know that reality is cruel? Do you want to tell dad that you're going to marry a rich guy... and you'll poison him to death to inherit his wealth? And I'll make money by prostituting and selling drugs? And dad would blackmail a hideous old woman? That would sound bad, wouldn't it? Don't be silly. Blackmail? Your sister is right. Reality is cruel. You've to be cruel to survive. I'm going to be rich soon. I don't have to die anymore. —You two can go out now... —Dad, so you were just pretending. —You lied to us! —So what if i did? —Get out or I'll stab you! —Let's go... Luckily I took photos to keep as records. Don't tell me that I have no ethics. I'm desperate now. This is my last chance to make money. If I blackmail a hundred thousand dollars from each of them... I'll get more than two million dollars in total. That's enough for the rest of my life! Why are you looking for me so urgently? Is there a problem with Chui's case? Do you have cigarette? —Do you smoke? —Once in a while. Here. —This is your last cigarette. —Yes, just take it. I'm going to quit smoking after finishing this pack. What's the matter? Hurry up and say it. Hurry and say it. I need to go home and wait for a call. There's something that I've been thinking about for a long time. I couldn't get to sleep for the past few nights because of this. So I made up my mind to tell you about it today. You know that I'm not from a rich family... but at least I've an apartment. My life is quite stable. I know English. My boss said that if I continue to work as a cop... I'd have a bright future. I know your background very well. I went through your file many times. You are indeed a bad and terrible girl. But if you can quit smoking and drinking... if you can stop going out with your bad friends... if you and your sister can stop making trouble... if you can take up a serious job for a year... then I'm willing to make a gamble. I want to marry you. All right. But... What is it? I've a condition too. I want you to cut something. What do you want me to cut? My fingers or my toes? I wouldn't treat you so cruelly. I know that you're good to me. When you told me about having a house, a car, and a baby with me last time... I was touched and I did consider about it. But I reminded myself that we are both poor. How could two poor people be able to live happily together? I will marry you and follow all your conditions... if you're able to cut yourself away from poverty. Ray? Ray, I'm here. Let's take a rest first, then we'll do it again. Ying! I'm not seducing your boyfriend. His mom won't allow him to marry you. He's going to leave you soon. I'm only earning three thousand dollars from him. Rose, let me explain. Ying, it's not my fault! It's just a misunderstanding. Siu Long Pau, you're no longer my friend! We're innocent. —I'm telling the truth! —Hey, Ying! It's all your fault! I told you I shouldn't come. Ying is so mad at me now! Give me another 1,000 dollars. 1,000 dollars? Give me a blowjob then. Go to hell! That'd be another 2,000 dollars! John wore a cool pair of earrings just now! Why are you in such a bad mood for the past two days? What's wrong? I've suddenly realised that life is so meaningless. Did you just finish reading a novel by Chiung Yao? Why did you hit me? I'm going to Lantau Island for a trip. Dad, hold on... what is this? Let me have a look. It's just some clothes. What's there to see? Don't touch it... —Put them down... —There's so much money! —Give them back to me... —Where do you get so much money? —Let me take some first... —Give them back to me... Give them back to him. —You're so stingy. —Put them down! Dad, how did you get so much money? That's right. Well, I used some photos to blackmail my old clients. Nine of them handed over the money easily... but three of them were very furious. So I'm going to Lantau Island to hide for a while. The two of you must be careful, all right? —All right. —Is it that serious? All the best! I'm doomed... —Hello? Sing? —Tramp, put the phone down. —What do you want? —Let go of me! Don't move! —What do you want? —It's so high! How do I jump? Come back! —Dad! —Dad! Let go of my dad! What are you doing? Let go of me! Let go of him! Let go of him! Why are you hitting my dad? Let's talk things over... Let go of him! Brother Wah, why are you here today? Darn you! You should know the reason. Stop hitting my dad! Darn Fatty, did you hear me? What do you take your clients for? You tried to blackmail them? Three of them, including Ah Lai, asked me to teach you a lesson. No, Brother Wah! That's not true! Let go of me! Don't hit my dad! Is this the money? I'll give everything back to you. And I guarantee that my dad won't do it again. —Can you let him go now? —It's not that simple. He might still have the negative and he'll blackmail them again. Why shouldn't I just put him in a sack and throw him into the sea? It would save me all future trouble. Fatty, we are all just trying to earn a living. Don't be so merciless. I can let him off... if you sleep with me for two years. —How dare you! —Go sleep with a sow! —Go to hell! —Sis! What do you want? Don't hit my sister! Go to hell! Darn Fatty! I'll kill you! Darn Fatty! Don't hit my sister! Let her go! Brother Wah, I'm sorry... this has nothing to do with my daughters. Darn Fatty! Stop hitting my sister! How dare you hit me! You must be tired of living! Let go of me! Darn you! I'll kick you to death! Go to hell! Brother Wah, it's not her fault. I'm sorry... it's all my fault... Darn Fatty, let go of me! I'm sorry, Brother Wah... Sis, help me! Fatty, you just want to quench your desire, right? Let me sleep with you instead. Come on. Fine, I'll take you instead. But you better serve me well. If I'm not satisfied, I'll take your sister too. Don't do it, Sis! —Let's go then. —Let her go. —Boss, this girl is fierce. —Brother Wah, please don't do this... Sis, don't do this for me! Let me do it instead! —Sis! —Brother Wah, I'm begging you... Get lost! Don't disturb me. Brother Wah, I'm sorry... Please let her go, Brother Wah... Brother Wah, I'm sorry! Please don't do this... I'm begging you, Brother Wah... Brother Wah! Please let her go... Get lost! Why did you hit my dad again? —Lie down! —Drag him out. No, leave him here. Since he likes to watch, I'll let him watch then. You slept with so many women before. Now you can watch me doing it with your daughter. This is called karma. Well, you're an expert in this. It's a waste of your talent if you're just watching. Why don't I hire you to be my sex instructor? I won't make you do it for free. Here's two hundred dollars for you as the instruction fee. Please don't do this, Brother Wah... I'm begging you, Brother Wah... Your skin is so smooth. It's velvety smooth. Awesome. Let me check if you're as good as new. I'll show you what a strong man can do. Sis, don't do it! This is so interesting! Is it fake down there too? Do I look like the Beatles now? —Boss is gasping so loudly. —He's having an orgasm now. Don't move! Brother Sing... Rose? Dad... Sis... It's tough to be a public defence lawyer. Especially for an unknown lawyer like me. I get little pay and I get cases which don't stand a chance to win. Lawyer, please don't say that. How high is the chance to win this case? There were only three of you in that room. At least seven people in the living room saw him entering the bedroom. You said it was self-defence? But they didn't bring any weapon. It was you who asked him to go into the room. And your fingerprints are found on that knife. If it's not murder, then what is it? What do you think are her chances? I think there's a ten percent chance for a twenty to thirty years jail term. There's a ninety percent chance for a death sentence. I'm sorry... Rose... do you regret it? I kept thinking about my past for the past few days. I really don't understand why I wasted my life. Rose... I know you're a bad girl. I know you never really loved me before. I know you were just making use of me all this while. But I couldn't help it. Because I really love you very much. Some people say that this is an ill-fated love. But if I have to see you being sent to the gallows... I'll be very devastated. I can't accept it. Miss Wong, how do you feel now? Do you think it's unfair if you receive the death sentence? Did you really kill him? Did anybody take advantage of you in the detention centre? Keep walking. Hurry up. —Get out of the way! —Stop pushing me! Stop looking around. Keep moving. —Ying... —Sis... Sis, don't be afraid! Dad and I will speak up for you! Don't be afraid! Sis! Please forgive me, Ying! —Ying, I'm sorry... —Don't be afraid... Please let us in... —It's full... —Sir, I'm the accused's father. —I'm the accused's sister. —All right, you can go in... —I'm her friend, please let me in. —No, you can't go in... It's already too crowded inside, don't make things difficult for me. I'm not letting anyone in anymore. Leave now. What's wrong with you? So what if you're a cop? Too bad for her. I'm the one to testify on her behaviour. With her countless bad records, I'll need a few hours to say everything. Madam, a witness shouldn't talk to outsiders. If you walk a bit slower, I'll beat you to death! Go ahead and testify against her! Just watch out that you and your mother's mouth will rot! That's good! —Madam. —What is it? The testimony that you gave in court just now was a bit overboard. I was just telling the truth. Trash like her should be put down. Good night. What do you want? You evil tramp! You caused Ying to be sentenced to death. I'm going to beat you up! —You dare to threaten a cop? —To hell with you! I'm going to use my Eagle Claw to break your limbs today! And I'll use my Springing Kick to kick your head! Come on! Don't talk so much. Just beat her! Siu Long Pau, you were so powerful when you hit Peter last time. —What happened to you today? —I don't know. I know why! You were so agitated that you weren't afraid last time. Siu Long Pau, try it again! I don't think I can do it again. Try to think like this. You let Ying down, right? This darn policewoman is trying to harm Ying now. How could you not help to avenge Ying? All right, darn policewoman! I'll fight with you! You're good! Was that your Shadowless Kick? Go to hell! I'll kick you to death! Am I dreaming? Evil tramp! Go to hell! Go to hell! Let's go! I did it! I'm finally terrific! Come in. Good evening, sir. Sir Kong sent me here to take the file for the rape case... which happened in Sai Yeung Choi Road. Are these the evidence of the case of the murder of the fat guy? The brass has sent out a memo that you can't be involved in this case. Yes, sir. An unexpected twist regarding the murder of Wah Da Wong. Fingerprints on the murder weapon vanished. The officer suspected to be involved in the obstruction of justice is in custody. Prosecutor, what is your stand on this matter? Judge, I hope you will accept the chemical report as exhibit in court. The report proved that the accused's fingerprints were on the knife. No way! This is not acceptable. In 1921, in the case of the Queen of Britain against Mrs Smith... based on the Privy Council decision... if the witness died or the exhibit was missing before the trial... the defence wouldn't be able to refute the statement of the witness... or the legitimacy of the exhibit. Based on the principle of fairness and justice... all statements or evidence deriving from the dead witness or missing exhibit... cannot be submitted to court. In addition, the judge and the jury would have to assume that... the witness and the exhibit never existed at all. In other words, we've to assume that no fingerprints existed on the knife at all. Although there's only one stab wound on the neck of the victim... which proved that there is only one killer... but the father and daughter might have conspired to commit the murder, right? Wah Da Wong suddenly turned up at the murder scene that day. They didn't know he would turn up at all. So how could they have conspired to kill him? Are you trying to insult my intelligence? Linda Wong and you conspired during the mahjong game last week. You purposely gave her the tiles that she needed to win. That's what I called conspiring! —You want to get an easy lay? —Sure. It's clear that there is only one murderer in this case. It means that either the accused or her father is innocent. The prosecution couldn't produce any evidence to prove who is innocent. Based on common law, the presumption of innocence... and the benefit of doubt... the court decrees that this case is dismissed. The accused shall be released immediately. I told you that you'll be fine! This judge is good and fair! Your name is cleared now. Mr Lai, how long have you been working as a cop? Did someone frame you in this case? —Sing... —Rose... Sing... Sing! I'll turn over a new leaf! I'll wait for you! Sing! Ching Tau Sing was guilty of the obstruction of justice... and was sentenced to seven years in prison. He was released four years later. Hai Wong Tat was sentenced to three years in prison for extortion. His business was doing very well in prison. Big Breasts Cat committed suicide when a scandal erupted... while she was in the Miss Hong Kong Beauty Pageant. Siu Long Pau married an African American navy soldier three years later... and she had a happy sex life after marriage. Crazy Chick Ying turned over a new leaf. She took a course in commerce and worked as a secretary. She married Ching Tau Sing six years later and they had a happy marriage. Liar Chui decided to study hard and she obtained a university degree. She became a pharmacist. She was arrested and sent to prison in 1972... for making and selling hallucinogens at the hospital.
