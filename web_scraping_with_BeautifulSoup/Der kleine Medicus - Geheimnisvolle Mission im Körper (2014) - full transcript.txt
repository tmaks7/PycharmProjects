♪ Music ♪ Good morning, my flying spies. Ready for another successful day's work? Fly, fly! Send me back the last missing details. We're nearly ready. Good luck! Oh! Get Out! Okay. What do you think, Grandma? This, or this? Marie, we're going to a health spa for one night. When not wearing a white bathrobe, you'll be sitting in a Jacuzzi. You're right. What was I thinking? Blue will clash with all that water. Silly me. Uh! Okay, Lord Groddock, this time I'm going to get you. Concentrate, concentrate, and jump! Shoot! I can do this. I know I can do this. I'm gonna pull you down into the canyon, and I'm gonna win. Hey, get out of the way! No! No. I'll get you next time, Groddock. Huh? Good grief, Nano, what are you doing? It's time for school. These bugs get bigger every year. Oh! That didn't sound good. Grandpa, are you all right? Whoa! I'm fine. Oh! And don't mention this to Grandma. We don't want her cancelling her trip. She's really looking forward to it. Well? Perfect. Can we go now? In these shoes? (tutting) Now, those shoes do not go with that hat. Not at all. And you should have seen the handbag she tried to put with that top. I laughed so hard I nearly fell off me chair. I'm so glad you're enjoying yourself, Serge. Oh, thank you. After all, that's why I invented my remote control spies. So you could spend your days thinking you're some kind of fashion expert. Really? I thought you invented them so we could copy Micro Minitech's shrinking machine. That's right. So, why am I looking at hats? Ow. And why on Earth are we at Sunday's house, and not at the lab, where our spy is supposed to be. I just wanted to check if Mr. Sunday had already left, because he's not here yet. Get it over to the lab, now. Yes, Professor Schlotter. Right away, Professor. Now, I don't want you boys getting in any trouble while we're gone. No, dear. What have you got in here? Oh, and I've made Nano's favorite cookies. They're on the kitchen table. I said Nano's favorite cookies. They're not for you. You know how they upset your stomach. Yes, dear. And don't forget to water the flowers. I know, dear. Come on, Grandma. Stop worrying, Rose, we'll be fine. Oh, come here, you silly old man. Oh! Ah! Are you all right? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yes. See you tomorrow, Granddad. Enjoy school, Nano. We've got the day off! Na-na-na, na-na, na! See you at work after school, Granddad. Okay. Bye! ♪ Music ♪ See ya! Whoa! Whoa! ♪ Just on the right way ♪ ♪ Come with me ♪ ♪ [Indistinct] you're in town ♪ ♪ To get the amazing Impression ♪ ♪ [Indistinct] ♪ ♪ In the city ♪ ♪ In the city ♪ ♪ In the city ♪ Oops! (musical honking) Hi there. Morning, Nano. Yes, quicker than yesterday. Nano! Hey, like, what is that thing? (laughing) Yeah, what a wreck. Granny misses you already, my little nutmeg. Bye. Little Nutmeg. (laughing) Whoa! So lame. Hi, Lilly. Do you know this little squirt? Sure. He's in my biology class. That's right. My name is ... Little Nutmeg, right? All right, Rappel. How does that feel? Perfect. Okay, then I guess we're ready. As soon as Dr. X returns from the school, we can start making preparations for tonight's maiden voyage. This time tomorrow, the world is gonna know the names Micro Minitech, Dr. X and Rappel. But, this isn't about our names. It's about creating a new technology that could save millions of lives. Impossible. They can't be ready. If they think I'm going to let them steal my idea and get away with it, they are gravely mistaken. I thought we were stealing their idea. Yeah, remember, because Minitech used to work here with us, and then she took her shrinking idea to Dr. X. So, we've been using our droids to spy on them and steal their ideas. Nobody asked you. Ow! Sure, maybe Micro Minitech did invent micro-tization. But, what is the point in inventing something if you don't know how to use it. Saving millions of lives? How short-sighted, and sickeningly noble. Only I, Professor Schlotter, have the foresight to realize the true capabilities of such an invention; to control the minds of mankind and rule the world! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Fix the lights. Yes, Professor. We've got work to do. Thank you so much for coming, Doctor. Very interesting. You're welcome. Nano. Great lecture, Dr. X. Microcosms are a fascinating subject. Blows my mind to think there are whole other universes existing right inside of us. That's what my work is all about, Nano, exploring those universes. Right now I'm working with Micro Minitech. She's the world's leading expert on micro-tization, shrinking, and I -- Oh, and I'm late. Give my best to your grandfather, Nano. Sure. Will do, Doctor. Like, duh. How boring was that. How would I know? I wasn't listening. I guess we're all lucky the exam's on Monday then. What? There's an exam on Monday! Yeah, Ms. Willshanks said it's on microcosms, and the world's smallest living things. Didn't you hear? I told you I wasn't listening. I can't fail biology this term. But what do I know about all that stuff. Why don't you ask Nano, because he's, like, the smallest living thing in the whole school. Whoa! (laughing) Don't you get tired of doing this every day? Nano, can I talk to you for a minute? Sorry, Lily, but I've got to go and see my granddad. If you want to make fun of me, you'll have to wait until Monday. Nano, wait! The exam is on Monday. I don't believe it. I'm actually getting smaller. Maybe the tree is getting taller. Well, anyway, I can't stay long today. I just wanted to tell you not to worry about me. School is okay, I guess, but it'd be a lot better if I was as big as the other kids. Oh, I get it. It's a sign, right? Little ant carrying a big leaf. Very clever. Being small can't stop me from doing whatever I want right? Wow, it's getting late. I better go meet Granddad. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. Ooh! Oh! Oh! Ooh! Is that as fast as you can work? I've repaired it boss. I know in our last tests it did make everything bigger, but now it really does shrink. Ah, you mean we finished? Yes. But now, we must test our -- your creation. Your creation. And, unfortunately, we no longer have our rabbit. Ah, I'd forgotten. That blasted Micro Minitech took my rabbit with her when she left. My precious, sweet little rabbit. Yes. What kind of person steals a man's bunny? I don't know. Why would she do such a thing? Oh, I believe, sir, it actually had something to do with the cruel and unusual experiments you were performing on the animal. Well, we had to test the shrinking machine on something before using it on my precious Gobot. But now, the time has come to shrink him for testing on a human. Anyway, we need a human. - Test on a human? But, Professor, we don't know if it's safe. We need more time. There is no more time. We must stop Micro Minitech from sharing her invention with the world. Her invention is now my invention. And the world will be mine. But, Professor, where are we gonna get a human? Ooh! Oh! Serge, prepare the shrinking chamber. Hey, excuse me! Okay. This way, Mr. Sunday. Very technical. Excellent. The perfect guinea pig. Okay, we're nearly there. Oops! Watch your step. Oh, nice place. Edwin Sunday, how are you? Professor Schlotter, if this is about the weeds in the rose garden ... My word, no. You're doing a splendid job on the gardens, just splendid. Oh. Thank you, Professor. But, I couldn't help but notice your back seems to be paining you. Well, it does give me a little trouble from time to time. I won't have any of my employees suffering. Let's have a look at you. I didn't know you were a doctor. Well actually, I am a professor of medical science. What's the difference? Oh, what's that? Gobot? It looks like a robot to me. That's nothing. You just get comfortable. Pssst. Put these somewhere safe. Somewhere safe? Oh, perfect. It's time our friend was awoken from his sleep. Oh, yes, Professor. That's right, Professor. Granddad! Granddad, where are you? Oh. What's that? Aaah. Oooh ooh. (Coughing) (Gasp) Hello! It's show time. Come to daddy. It's working! This way my mechanical friend. Out you go, just through the -- Sorry. Not quite. All right. Emergency action. Up the stairs. There we go. And, careful. Through here. And about turn! Make yourself comfortable. Lovely. Maybe I should come back another time? That rose garden won't weed itself, you know? Don't be silly, Mr. Sunday. We'll have you right as rain in no time. All systems go. Wait there. I'll be back in a moment. Truly, you are a vision. Oh, thank you. Well lie down now. Seatbelts on. Snug as a bug in a rug. Okay. Closing capsule. Capsule closed. (Laughing) I told you not to leave, Micro Minitech. And look, I'm getting there first. Extracting Gobot. There he is. (Laughing) Gobot ready, sir. Careful! Nobody move. I thought we'd lost him there for a minute. Ready? Ready. Serge, I thought I told you to get those lights fixed? But I did. Serge! Oh, you look different. Actually, that's not me, Professor. Well, then who is it? I'm Nano, and I saw everything. Nano? What do you mean everything? What are you doing here? Grandad, are you all right? I'm fine. Professor Schlotter just fixed my back. I've never felt better. Really? Absolutely. Come on, Nano, let's go. But, the monster robot, I saw it. What are you talking about? Oh, to have the brain of a child. Of course, I don't mean, you know, in a jar or anything. I'm not that kind of professor. I just mean, kids are great, aren't they? I can't thank you enough, Professor. Not at all, not at all. Now, if you don't mind, I have a lot of work to do. You'll find your own way out, right? But grandad! Not now, Nano. The Professor is a very busy man. But, Professor, you heard the boy, he saw everything. Stop worrying, Serge. Even his own grandfather didn't believe him. Now, make sure they leave, then power up the suit. If you're not going to eat your dinner, at least try some of grandma's biscuits. She made them specially for you. I'm not hungry. Nano, it's not that I don't believe you, it's just that the Professor works in a creepy old factory full of junk and shadows. Those things can play tricks on young eyes. I know what I saw, grandad. For the last time, Nano, there is nothing strange going on at Professor Schlotter's factory. Now what is the problem? There seems to be something wrong with the motor, professor. A problem with the motor? I know what you can do. What? Fix it! I'll get it. There we go. You should have control now. Hi Nano. Lilly. What are you doing here? Just came by to say hi, and to ask you to help me with Monday's biology exam. What? My parents said I can't go to dance camp this summer if I don't get my grades up. There's a dance camp? I always wondered where girls learned all their moves. Hello? Oh, sorry. What do you want me to do about it? You're a biology geek -- I mean, you're good at biology. You could give me private lessons. The exam is on Monday. That doesn't give us much time. How much of the course book have you already covered? Book? I didn't know there was a book. We should probably start right away. Yes! It's working, Professor, it's working! Excellent. You sure you want to do this? As sure as my place in history. Grandad, uh, this is Lilly. Pleased to meet you, Lilly. No, Grandad, it's me, Nano. This is Lilly. Pleased to meet you, Lilly. Nice to meet you too. Are you feeling all right, Grandad? Affirmative, Nu-nu...Nu-nu. But, I'm Na-no! The boy knows something is wrong. Just act normal. Get the Gobot to give him a cookie. Kids love cookies! Good idea. Oh, cookies. Watch out! Would you like to ingest a cookie? Um, no thanks, Grandad. No thank you, Mr. Sunday. They are most agreeable. Grandad, you're not supposed to eat those. They upset your stomach. Time to put the cat out. Where is the front door? This way, Grandad. Oh! Phew! Release Grandad. Let me out! Let me out! Did you just lock your grandfather in the pantry? That's not my grandfather. He looks like my grandfather, but that's not my grandfather. What you talking about? You didn't think he was acting weird? He's old. All old people are weird. Besides, what's so weird about wanting to put out the cat? We don't have a cat. Okay. That's kind of weird. But, you can't just leave him in there. Well, I can't let him go out when he's like this. You should probably get a doctor. Dr. X! Hello? Hello? There's nobody there. But the lights are on. Probably can't hear the buzzer. Must be a code for the lock, right? Are you crazy? You can't just figure out the code. Why not? Codes are usually something obvious. Let's see, the doctor's name is Dr. X. So, D-R-X. And the house number is 221. Password rejected. You actually thought that was going to work. Why not just close your eyes and pick any random number ... Password accepted. Cool. It worked? Come on. We can't just let ourselves in. It's an emergency. Well, at least if I end up in jail, I won't have to do that biology exam. Strange. He's not in his office, or his consultation room. You know this place? Sure. Dr. X is my family doctor. I came here when I broke my wrist. I was waving at my grandma from my skateboard and ... Hey, look. Dr. X? Hey, wait! Who was that? No idea. But, I've seen stranger things today. Come on! Decontamination beginning. Decontamination beginning. Where are we? I don't know, but I've got a bad feeling about this. Two minutes to micro-tization. What is this place? No idea. Ninety seconds to micro-tization. Initializing shrinking sequence. Micro-tization sequence initiated. Micro-tization process complete. Wow! Are you ready doctor? Quite ready, thank you. Can you hear us, bodynaut Rappel? Loud and clear. Body cam, on. Body cam, on. Rappel to base. Location, mouth. Observation, cavity in molar seven. Dental attention necessary. Doc, you should brush your teeth. Copy that. Okay, doctor. Please drink the water now. Whoa! Going down the esophagus. Woo-hoo. Woo. Yee-hee-hee. Ya-ha-ha-hoo. Entering the stomach. Deploying engines, standing by. Stomach level. You have arrived at your destination. Oh, what is that? It's an ulcer, Rappel. Can you get a measurement on the acidity? Send the data through right now. Hmm, okay. Let's get some antacid on there. Whoa! Experiencing an unexpected pressure wave of immeasurable magnitude. Oh! What's going on up there? Sorry, Rappel. The safety cord, you bit through the safety cord. Mayday. Mayday. Release the safety cord. Will do. Dr. X, we have to get Rappel out of there. We can't wait for Mother Nature to do her thing. What do you suggest? Castor oil. Wooooo! Whoa! Good grief! Ahhh! Oh, my! Ooooo! Oh, that was quick. Where did he go? Oh, no. Mission accomplished. Hmm. Oh, gross. The things I do in the name of science. Reverting to normal size. Restoring size to 100%, complete. We did it. And Rappel doesn't have a scratch on him. I guess it takes a little more than that to rattle old Rappel. Oh! Oh! Mama. Ow! Ah, stop moving around. Let me see. Not now, Grandma. Ahem! Nano, what are you doing here. Sorry, doctor. I was looking for you. Well, you found me. And lots more, besides. They saw everything. Thankfully not everything. What else is there? A talking rabbit? Oh, right. That. So that's what you do here, experiment on animals? Oh, no. We would never do that. It's true. Micro Minitech was the one who saved me from the nasty experiments of a very evil professor, but not before I doubled in size and developed the ability to talk. Anyhoo, that's when I started working with MM and the doc here. I'm the world's first bodynaut. Okay. Now they know everything. Alley-oop. You're right. They know too much, and there's only one way to make children keep a secret. Watch out! Okay. If I give you these nice looking lollypops, will you promise not to tell anybody about what you saw? It's just that there are some people out there who could use my technology to do terrible things, if they knew it existed. So ... what do you say? Hmm, I don't suppose you've got a smartphone in there. We won't say a word, I promise. Wow. I can't wait to tell everybody at dance camp about this. Nuh-uh. Okay. Fine. I won't tell anyone. So please. Come and have a look at my grandfather. There's something really wrong with him. Ugh, not his back again. All right then, let's go and take a look at your grandfather. I don't understand it. He was right here. You keep your grandfather in the pantry. And humans think I'm strange. I cannot believe a man of his year had so much strength. There's been a breach of security at the complex! The breach is in the lab. Let's go see. Okay. Calm down. Calm down, Mr. Sunday. Destroy. Destroy. I have to destroy the laboratory. Oh, I'll calm down all right, when I've destroyed your lab. Destroy. Destroy. Come on. I'll do it. What's happening? That's enough. Calm down. Destroy! Destroy! Prepare the injection. Calm down. Calm down, Mr. Sunday. Oh! Yes. Granddad! What have you done with my granddad? Your grandfather's fine. He's just been sedated. What would possess him to break in and destroy our laboratory? We've lost control of the Gobot and Sunday. Bring up the drone cam. I want to know what's going on in that lab. Aye aye, sir. Let's move him over to the scanning room. Serge, we'll have to go there to reboot the Gobot manually. So I'll need my blueprints. Fetch them. Yes, sir. But I put them in a safe place like you asked. Confound it, you imbecile. Just tell me where they are. I hid them in the Gobot. You did what? Well I thought that was the last place anyone would look for them. Let me get this straight. You hid my blueprints, my only copy, my painstakingly handwritten years of research in the Gobot? Aye. But what if this Gobot was destroyed and I needed to build another one? Oh, that's simple. Just get the blueprints and ... oh. I see. We better go and get it. Really? Or would you not prefer to stay here and order a pizza? Well, I am kind of hungry. Ready my truck! Full body scan initiated. How are his vitals? Hmm. These don't look good. Heartbeat, 120. Is that good? Good resting heart beat is around 60 beats per minute. What's that? Look! Something's wrong here. Hmm. It's an alien particle, and it's moving very aggressively up his spine. That's the robot I saw at Schlotter factory. Are you sure? Sure I'm sure. But it's smaller. It's the Gobot. He's actually finished it. This is bad. (bugle call) Wrong. It's awfully bad. So Schlotter was using the Gobot to control Granddad. You catch on fast. With this kind of technology, there's no telling what evil he might unleash on the world. We need to get the Gobot out now. I'll go in, but with this busted flipper, I won't be able to use the control. Granddad! Hmm. If only we had another rabbit bodynaut or someone as small as a rabbit. I'm not as small as a rabbit, right? You're right. I'm taller. It could work. We're not sending that small boy on this mission. Would people stop calling me small! Ugh! We'll operate and get the Gobot out the old fashioned way. Hmm. Where do I make the incision? The Gobot is moving too fast. Sending in Nano may be our only option. I'm not sending Nano in alone. He won't be alone. You're too tall, Lily. Oh, yeah? Don't say a word. Hey. You're as small as me. So, what do you say? Lily is still taller. No. Not about that. About sending us in. My dad once told me, "You're never too small to be hero." We've never shrunk anything to such a small scale before. And even worse, never a human. No way. It's too risky. We're going to operate and that's it. Let's prep him. Grandma, what's wrong with you? Oh, nothing. It's just a face mask, but where's Grandpa? He won't answer his phone? He's, uh, lying down. Nano Sunday, what's going on? I'm with Lily. Uh, hi. We're studying microbiology. Nano, no phones in here. Grandma, I gotta go. Rappel, take them outside, please. We can't risk contamination. Come on, guys. Please doctor. You've got to save my grandfather. Don't worry. We'll get this Gobot. Get your hands off my Gobot. Ey up! Was that Rappel? My pet, rabbit? We've lost the feed. It's back, but where are we. Please help me. I've got to save my granddad. Let me guess. You want me to shrink you right? Yes! Let's do it. Decontamination beginning. Don't worry. You'll be fine. I was nervous my first time too. Hmm. Dark gray or dark gray. Hm. First off, this is basically your steering wheel. It works like a computer joystick. Push it forward ... And it goes forward. I'm familiar with that technology. You have enough oxygen for about 30 minutes. Green is good ... Red is bad. Exactly. You each have an emergency pack under your seat, which will give you an extra five minutes. Hmm. Let's hope you don't need it. Oh! This is our patented micro laser technology. It's good for blasting ulcers or unwanted fatty tissue. Or Gobots? Right. Use it wisely. Any trigger happy shooting could leave your grandfather with internal scarring. Oh. And this thing here is used to extract samples. And finally, and most importantly, watch out for these critters. These are immune cells. Their job is to protect the body from foreign invaders. Germs, viruses ... And us? Precisely. If they catch you, they will destroy you. That doesn't sound good. We have one secret weapon though. All right. Micro Minitech added a force field which will protect you for about 30 seconds. So that you can get away from any cells that are attacking you. The sub is also coated with antiacid, which will protect you from stomach acid. And finally ... Let me guess, the pencil shoots out some sort of liquid that will help us destroy the Gobot. No. This is a waiver. It states that you're going into the shrinking machine of your own free will and will not hold me or anyone associated with the lab responsible for any unforeseen problems that might occur during the expedition. If I can give you a bit of advice my uncle Fluffytail gave to me, it's this: we rabbits are famous for one thing ... Eating carrots? Big ears. No! Bravery, courage. Never giving up and sticking together. Really? Not big ears? Just get in the capsule. Okay then. Let's go. Okay. Yeah. Good luck little humans. You guys ready? Ready! Whooaa!! The Gobot is overriding his synapses. That's how Schlotter was able to control him. If his fever gets any worse, it may be too dangerous to operate. It's our only hope. No it's not. We have two bodynauts who have been prepped and are ready to go. Please don't tell me you shrunk the children? Did you shrink the children? Micro Minitech doesn't want me to tell her. Are you nuts? I got them to sign a waiver. We have to bring them back to normal size and quickly. Why didn't I see this before? You've been experimenting on animals. What? No. That's when I was a student working for Schlotter. And by the way, don't forget I was the one who saved you from him. However, you were still happy to risk my safety when you shrunk me, but not these kids? He's got a point. When the press arrive later for the big launch, I won't be here. Rapple, wait. He will calm down. What do you say, Micro Minitech. As long as they follow our instructions, it might work. Why do I get the feeling I'll regret this. Aaahh!! Base to bodynauts, do you read me? Bodynaut Nano Sunday reading you loud and clear. And Lily too. We think the Gobot is heading towards Mr. Sunday's brain. It must be neutralized. Follow the spine up to the cranium. No pressure, but if you guys don't destroy the Gobot, it will destroy you and your grandfather. Schlotter will win. Oh, no pressure then. Why don't we just go through the front door? That's exactly what they'll be expecting us to do. This way we have the element of surprise. Oh! Hm? Gah! This thing is heavy. I've got to warn the others. Hey, boss. You've got to see this. Unbelievable. I never knew Granddad was so amazing. Look at this. Did you know that there are 23 disks in the spine? And here we go. Woo-hoo. Yeah! Whoa! Watch out. Whoa. Look out! Oh, sorry. Oh, this doesn't look good. Ah, your grandfather's slipped disk. We'll have to treat it locally. Select A34 from the treatment menu. It's the laser. Be careful. Activating laser. Yeah! Good shot, Nano. Well done. You've cured your grandfather's slipped disk. Oh. Don't worry, my frightened little beast. I'll never let you go again. We'll be back for you when our work is done. Shh! Let's go. Have you got the Gobot control suit? Uuhh! There you are! Oh! Oh no! Immune cells. Children, you'll need to listen very carefully. Attention, immune cells detected. We're listening. Cut the red wire. Oh, right. The red wire. The red wire. We've lost communication. If they get a hold of us, we're done for. They don't look very friendly. Uh-oh. This is about to get interesting. So, what did Rappel tell us to do? Can't remember. Aahh! Force field, force field! We did it! Thank goodness for that. Dr. X, please check that the kids are okay. It looks as if Mr. Sunday is stabilized for now. Surprise. Professor Schlotter has taken over your compound. Huh? What? I'm here to get my Gobot. Don't get me reason to use it. Tie them up. Yes, Professor. You'll never get away with this. Oh, thank you, Dr. X, for that tired old cliché. So, my Gobot is heading towards Sunday's brain. It's attracted by the electromagnetic activity, not that there's a lot going on upstairs with this old coot. Rebooting. Well, well ... it appears I can kill two birds with one stone. I retrieve my Gobot and destroy your capsule. There are children in there. Experimenting on children, are we now? Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk. I don't think the police will like the sound of that. You're a monster. No, you're a monster, both of you. You're a two headed monster. A cyclops. Not a cyclops. That's a thing with one eye. You're a hydra. These poor, unfortunate children are about to have a terrible accident. And guess who's going to get the blame? You too. That's who. Now, Gobot. Let's get going. We have to deal with these annoying children. Did he say annoying children? He can't mean us. We're hardly children. I mean I'm nearly 13. Well, I can be annoying. He's going to find out. I want to go home. Okay. Maybe we are still children. It's okay, Lily. All we have to do is destroy the Gobot and get out of here before we run out of oxygen. How long do we have left? 20 minutes. And if I've learned anything from fighting Lord Groddock, it's attack is the best form of defense. Let's go! Who's Lord Groddock? You've never played Hobgoblin Homicide? A computer game? You're basing our strategy on a computer game? Why not? I feel so much better. Wow. Look at that down there. It's the small brain and it controls our tiniest movements. We've got to keep our eyes peeled for the Gobot. Look! There it is over there. Uh-oh. So I have company. How nice. Watch out! It's coming. Nano! Do something! I'm trying. I thought you said you were good at computer games! This isn't a game, Lily! Be careful! That's your grandfather's brain! Ahh! Come on, come on. We're stuck. Let me try something. What are you doing? It worked on the gate, didn't it? 316, anti-inflammatory spray. What's anti ... anti-inflammatory? Helps calm something inflamed. You know, an irritation. I suppose you could say a Gobot is an irritation. Yeah. I suppose so. Ah-ha. Okay. Push it. Leave them alone. Okay. I'll do just that. I'll leave them all alone. Stuck in the brain. Ah, what's the best way to get my Gobot out of this old fool? Um, the intestine. Huh. It's leaving. We won. We won! Yeah. Warning. Oxygen level, critical. Six minutes and counting. Not yet. We've got to get out of here, and we don't have much time. This isn't good. Got it. Huh? Hmm. It says you need to turn on your body-wiki. You need to ... Wish me luck. Good luck. You stay by the laser and cover me if the Gobot comes back. Remember, you only have enough oxygen to last five minutes. Okay. Capsule hatch, opened. I'm going to push, and I need you to reverse full throttle. Gotcha. It worked. We're free. Lily, wait! Attention! Killer cells detected. Nano, out of the way! Stop! There are killer cells everywhere. What do I do? Don't panic. It's a little late for that. Use the laser. Cut a hole so we can get into the main artery. Into the blood. This is no time to get squeamish. Entering artery. Yeah! Nano? Are you still there? Everything okay? Yes. I'm fine thanks. Good job, Lily. Now will you please open the emergency hatch? Capsule hatch, opened. Phew. That was a close one. Grandma, your eyes. Cucumbers. I'm still trying to reach Grandpa. Is everything okay? Yeah. All's fine. Arteries look nice and clear. Watch out for the wall! Nano, are you playing computer games again? Grandma, these cucumbers do not go with my robe. Do they come in different colors? Oh, Marie. I better go. Just a thought. Maybe don't answer phone calls from your grandmother when you're flying through your grandfather's arteries. Oh. Warning. Our oxygen's nearly out. We better be quick. We can go through the lung, exit out the windpipe and out the mouth. You learn fast. Only one problem ... Which is? We have to destroy the Gobot in order to save my granddad. Ironically, Granddad's high blood pressure is helping us move faster. Schlotter, this is Nano Sunday. I was just wondering why your Gobot is running away from a couple of children. What is Nano doing? Running away. You think I'm afraid? Prove it. Meet us in the stomach. With pleasure. Wow! Your grandpa's heart is huge. Listen. I want you to know I'm sorry I got you messed up in this. I'm not. Who knew hanging out with a pipsqueak could be so exciting? Pipsqueak! This is a really good thing you're doing for your grandfather. I owe him a lot. He and grandma have looked after me and Marie ever since my parents died. You're saying he has a big heart. I get it 'cause we're in his heart. And from our perspective, it's ginormous. Very good. What you're saying is heartfelt. Yes, I got that too. Sorry. I didn't have the heart ... Okay. That's enough. Where are we going now? Uh, past the diaphragm and into the stomach. So during breathing, the diaphragm contracts, which helps to draw air into the lungs. I'm getting the hang of this body stuff. And that ... No. Don't tell. It's the liver. And it aids ... Digestion. Actually, when you think about it, it doesn't matter who we are. We're all the same inside. That's pretty deep. Thanks. I mean, the intestine, where the Gobot is. Look. That sausage-looking thing? Where are we? Near the fundus. It's part of the stomach. Stomach low. Warning. Oxygen level critical. We'd better make this quick. Stay alert. Look. Okay, young man. Now, we'll see who's running away. Well done. This calls for my secret weapon. Uh-oh. Didn't see that coming. Oh! Oh! He cut off our laser. Yeah! Force field sequence enabled. Okay. Deactivated. What are we going to do now? Well, I've got a plan. But I need your help. Please tell me you know what you're doing. Of course I know what I'm doing. I can do this. I know I can do this. Yes. Now I've got you. High speed descent detected. Push it! No! No! Yeah! Yay! Well done. Me Gobot. My blueprints. Oh. Oh. Warning. Oxygen level critical. One minute and counting. Evacuate immediately. Suggested exit via the colon. No way. That would take too long anyway. We need to go through the lungs. So we're going to have to share oxygen. It's just like buddy breathing in scuba diving. I've never been scuba diving. Oh. Well, if we make it out of here, we should definitely give it a try. Recalculating route. Serge. What's -- what's going on? Hold it. Keep away from him, Schlotter. Game over. Rappel, call the police. Done. And not just to the police. Schlotter, maybe you'd like to explain yourself to the world media. They're waiting outside. And I thought you'd left us. You know me. I never miss a chance to be a hero. A-ha. Not so fast. One more move, and Granddad is history, and the children too. Now, back off. Entering lungs through alveole. Crossing bronchi. I want a helicopter with a full tank of fuel and a private island with monkeys and my own reality TV series. Where's the capsule? Entering nasal passage. Ooh-ee. Gesundheit. Okay. Okay. Forget the helicopter. Just get me a tissue. Get it off me. Professor Schlotter, can you give us a statement? (muttering) Starting revert to normal size. (gasping) Welcome back, bodynauts. Mission accomplished. Boy, is it good to see you guys again. This is going to herald a new age of scientific discovery. Everyone will know the names of Micro Minitech because of her micro therapy. I couldn't have done it without your help Dr. Xiang, And of course, my two brave bodynauts. (clears throat) Sorry, three brave bodynauts. Yeah. We make a good team. But maybe it's best we keep this our little secret for the time being. Little? You're right, big secret. (door bell rings) Hi, Lilly. Hi, Nano. Come in. Morning, Granddad. Must have dozed off. In a shocking case of corporate espionage, big player in the field of micro technology was arrested last night while trying to destroy the premises of the Dr. X Foundation. Oh, dear, Professor. How long was I asleep? Excuse me. Spot of indigestion. Have we met before, dear? No. But Nano has told me so much about you, I feel like I know you inside-out. Hello. We're home. Hello, girls. Welcome back. Nice bag. Thanks. Nice shoes. So anything strange happen while we were away? Uh, Lilly and I have to go. Nice to meet you. I like Nano's new girlfriend. She's not my girlfriend. She's my friend who's a girl. Yeah, sure. Okay. Well done, Nano, as usual. And you, Lilly, surprisingly good. Yay, yay, yay, yay! Yay! Well done, Lilly. I totally nailed it. Yeah, cool. That was a fun way to study. I know. Let's get started on next week's chapter. Look. Reckon birds can loop the loop. Uh, no. Definitely not, Lilly. No, Lilly. Whoa! Woo-hoo! Whoa. Lilly! Lilly! Whoa! Yay! Whoa! ♪ Music ♪ Schlotter has been remanded in custody, awaiting trial that could see him locked away for a long time. Why can't there be some good news on TV for a change? My drone. It's alive!
