Man, why don't you call Antonio? You've been telling me all trip long to forget him, and now I should call him? Yes, just to get us out of here. Then you can happily tell him to get lost. So, do you know now who you're going to call? - You're so annoying. - Watch your mouth. I am fed up already. What do you mean to do? Lock me up? I'm already in jail. You can do nothing! That's what you think. Calm down. Stop provoking him. I'm running out of patience. Either you call now or the three will be here until Monday. The proper way to say it is 'the three of you'. Fuck off, and you of the three will stay here until Monday. - He got mixed up. - Right. Officer, wait a second, please. - I got his restaurant's business card. - Again? You have donuts? You always do on TV. - That's the American police, the fat ones. - I'm hungry. - Another little push? - I can't wait to get out of here. OK. - Could you please bring me my purse? - Sure, like the nice little hotel this is. Fuck it, Alcalá. We have fucking cancer! 9 MONTHS BEFORE THE WISH LIST So much love! You're the one that gives most love of all. That's it now, that's it. - Hey, how is Pinta doing? - She didn't eat anything yet. - And she won't let me touch her. - Oh, my God. - She didn't eat anything at all? - Nothing at all. We'll have to do something or nobody will take her. A second half still remained to break off a 3-century long in communication. We ran out. And I won't take the pill anymore. That's fine. - I'll go to the drugstore myself right now. - Sit down! Just now you couldn't be bothered to get bread and now you'll run to the drugstore? Not having bread and being a father are really different issues, honey. Antonio, what's up? You don't want a child or what? I do. - My biological clock is clocking out. - I know, honey. - I just need more time. - How much time? - Two years. - Two years? - You have two months. - How did we go from 2 years to 2 months? - You want to make it two weeks? - No, no, no! OK, OK. Two months. Two months then. Don't be upset. Guys, I told you before. De Niro for De Niro, Pacino for Pacino. Will I have to tell you again? They're good people, love. Be patient. Honey! - Look what I got! - Don't yell! - What's that? - I got a present for you. You will be amazed. It's my way of saying sorry for earlier. I love presents. Come on, open it. You'll see! - What the fuck is this, Antonio? - 36 boxes of contraceptive pills. What now? I say I want to be a mother and your answer is 3 years worth of pills? - Are you stupid? - Don't be like that. I had to visit 4 different drugstores. I looked like a character from Narcos. - I shouldn't be like this? - What's wrong? You know what? I'm leaving you! It's over! I don't ever want to see your fucking face again! - Please... - He really is stupid. Stupid. - What happened? - Men. That's what happened. - When did you get a dog? - Today. - Pinta, meet Mar. Mar, meet Pinta. - What about De Niro and Pacino? They haven't talked yet, but I think they're happy with their sister. - I'm glad. You got wine? - Yes. - Open a bottle. I'll leave this in my room. - OK. I wish it were true, But I know you will go back to Antonio tomorrow. No, no. It's over for real. I'm sick and tired. It's not like any other time before, no. And let me tell you something. If I ever want to go back, if I ever want to call him up, you can just hit me. OK. I will punch you in your face. I am sick of little boys. I want real men. Men who will accept a commitment. - Men who are not afraid. - Baby, there are no real men. Some men... Some men, I don't know, who'll look at you, will want you... They will kiss you with a look. Well, they do not exist. Now there are only bodybuilders with tattoos, hipsters... Falling in love is impossible. That's just the way it is. - This talk is really cheering me up. - Girl, I'm sorry. Give me more wine. I have 5 years worth of man to forget. Let's go, wine. - Let's see. - What's wrong? Nothing is wrong. Well, I need you to touch one of my boobs. - Touch one of your boobs? - I'm not joking. - I'm not that desperate. Are you? - You're a moron. No, I'm not. For real, I need you to touch my right boob. Please, Mar. Feel it. Let's see if you find anything. What? You can feel it, right? - It might be a deposit of fat. - Yes, it might be. I hope so. - OK, now. - What now? - You can let go of my boob now. - Sorry. - Did you like it? - It will do to wank once. It's your first time? - Sorry, you were saying? - Yes, is this your first time? Yes, it is my first time. You can ask me anything you need to know. My name is Carmen. Eva. Nice to meet you, Carmen. Thank you so much. Welcome, of course. Here we are all fighting the same battle. - It's not the first time for you, right? - No. I've been fighting this motherfucker for some 25 years now. But I'm winning because I'm still here, fucking around and stronger than ever. I imagine you'd like to know how chemo will affect your body. I would, yes. I hear all sorts of different things, but I don't know what will happen. I'll sum it up for you. You will throw it all up and you will go bald. But don't you worry. The vomiting will stop and your hair will grow again. Some days you won't be able to move because you will be too tired. You live alone? With Mar, my best friend. So much better, because Mar will help in those days. But eventually, the hardest effects of chemo will pass too. It's my third time here. Stage 4 carcinoma. - 3 times through this already? - Yeah. I got the same thing in stage 2, I think. How was your surgery? OK. So said the doctor. The tumor was removed, and also the surrounding tissue. Mine was OK too. So don't feel down, man. We will be like always in a jiffy. You have to fight that motherfucker. - Thank you, Carmen. - You're welcome. Look, there's Paco. - Paco, meet Eva, my chemo buddy. - Nice to meet you, Paco. - This is Mar. - You're Carmen, I guess. Surprise dictation. Girls, never marry or have a boyfriend. Full stop. The best you can do is to remain single, comma, to enjoy life, comma, to freeze your eggs, and to be strong independent women because we don't need men to be happy. Full stop. Prof, you may be a bit old, but you can still find love. A bit old, you say? A giant D minus, smart-ass. What about your parents? - My morn passed when I was 20. - I'm so sorry. My dad went to Argentina 4 years earlier, and I never saw him again. So, my only family is Mar. Don't you worry, I won't leave you alone. And we will fight this fucker together. - Your worst chemo was the first one? - Yeah. We didn't have as much information. And the mortality rate was high. I was so scared I thought I'd never be 30. So I made a list. 3 things I'd like to do if I survived. - What were those 3 things? - Taking my kids to EuroDisney, sailing down the Nile with my Paco, and... - And changing someone's life. - You got to do all 3 things? - Yes. Well, 2 out of 3. - Which one was left? I'll tell when you bring your list. 3 things you'd like to do when we beat this fucker. I bet there's something you always wanted to do but never dared. - An unfulfilled wish... - Yeah. Now you have work for the next day. Making the list and shaving your head. - Me, shaving my head? - Your hair already started to fall off. - Just a bit. - It will get worse fast. So shave it off. Or else one clay your hair will be on your pillow. And that's truly nasty. - Carmen is right. I have to shave it off. - Yes, absolutely. You think it will become me? - Natalie looked fine. - Which one? Natalie Portman? Right, but she's one of the prettiest women in the world. You're cute too, and I see you more like Charlize. Why don't we go to a beauty parlor? No, dear. It's not like asking to have the ends cut off. This I have to do on my own. That's that then. Two cats losing hair is more than enough already. I'm so bad at this. I have no clue. Learning how to surf, sleeping in the desert and crashing a wedding. I love it. A very good list. Just one detail. Any particular desert? Any desert in Morocco. That way I can also visit Asilah. I'm told it's beautiful. It is, you will see. The one thing I didn't do was changing someone's life. But that's part of my job. I'm a stylist. You should drop by my store and I'll do a full make over. Count on it. You're always full of surprises. - I wish we could fulfill our lists together. - You wish? Right after our last chemo session, before we know the results, we are going on a trip to complete our lists. How can we possibly go on a trip without even knowing the results? Exactly because of that. Nothing is worse than staying at home waiting for the results. - Thinking all the time you may die. - You have good points, - but it's a bit crazy. - I'll do logistics. I have experience. But, before you give me more excuses, ask yourself one question. If death is so eternal and life is so brief, why would I stop doing the things I want which make me happy? Why? - That smile means we're going on a trip? - That smile means you always persuade me. - Can Mar come along? - Of course. So tell her to start her list and start packing, because we are going on a trip. To feel alive and eat as much life as we can in a week. As Quevedo said, yesterday is gone, tomorrow is not here yet and today is going. But no cell phones. Here we talk face to face, and we look into each other's eyes. - Fuck my phone. We look at each other. - That's the way I like it. And you too. Mar, read your list for us. OK. Sleeping in a jail cell, driving an SUV on the seashore and fucking a Dane. Why a Dane? A Swede or a Norwegian won't do? No, it has to be a Dane. Since I visited Copenhagen with Antonio I fell in love with them. They're so hot. Even the ugly ones are hot. That trip was really cool. I had a great time. - Carmen, please, stop a second. - You're not feeling well? I'm great. I just need to stop a moment. OK, I'll stop here. - What are you doing? Are you nuts? - I'm hitting you, honey. - You were thinking of Antonio. - I wasn't. Really? Maybe I was, just a bit. Look, he calls me to say goodbye, then he says he wants to get back together. - Now he wants to give me another chance. - But you left him. Right, but he was never a smart one. You want to be a mother since high school. Antonio never wanted to be a father. If you go back to him, you know what's what. He's a dick. And a bastard. And an idiot. And a moron. Carmen, you don't know him. Look, a guy cannot be a good person that gives 36 boxes of contraceptive pills to a woman that wants to be a mother. Not for you, not for anybody. I'll rest now. I'm hurting from slapping you. Chemo gets you exhausted and takes your strength. It's normal she's tired. - You're sure she's fine? - Yes. Before this trip I binge-watched films about cancer. I am a bit obsessed. - What films did you watch? - Terms of Endearment, 4th Floor, 50/50, - Notting Hill and Pretty Woman. - Those two are not about cancer. They're about the worst cancer of all. Love. Those movies are just lies. And Julia Roberts is just a slut. I hate her. That is your problem. ldealising love and men. You're single. Enjoy yourself. Forget Julia Roberts and fuck a Dane. I'm at 80, the speed limit. What does this idiot want? - What is wrong with you? - I knew it. It had to be a woman. - Asshole. - It had to be a woman? Fuck your life, you shit baldy! Where's the turbo speed? Nobody can fuck with me. - What if it's a Dane? - Then I'll think about it. - Friend. - Yes? Wait for me out front, with the engine running and the back door open. Don't ask. - What are you going to do? - I said don't ask. - Look where the fuck you're going. Look! - I'm so sorry. Well, it had to be a woman. Power for women! Me too! Long live my pussy! - Long live her pussy? - Run! Start the engine! I should have added kissing a stranger to my list. Then add it. Go on. We're here to do what we want. So, eat the mouth of the first guy that turns you on. Or even the second one. And you go fuck a Dane. There must be a lot of Danes in here. You know what? The first Dane I see, I'll screw him. Really? I'm going to the toilet. I'll be right back. I wanted to say something I think I never said to you. - You're scaring me. - I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for making me laugh when I really didn't want to. Thank you. - You silly, I love you so much. - I am very lucky. - I'm not here just because I love you. - No? I did it because you're my landlady and I need a place to live. You're so shameless. - I can't believe it. - My friends are dying to meet you. Mar, here's a Dane. - That was fast. - Hi, Mar. I am Magnus. Hi, Magnus. I be Eva. - Can we talk for a second? - Sure thing. - So you're just all talk? - No. But he's the ugliest guy in Denmark. You got some nerve. You said, I quote, 'The first Dane I see, I'll screw him.' - That's a Dane, even if you won't look. - But he's wearing a tikki. - That's because of the wind. - Are you sure he's a Dane? - Ask him yourself, go. - Let's see, Magnum. Do you have British blood, by any chance? That would explain a lot. No, I be 100% Danish. I don't get why nuts lady brought me here. I was getting beer. She got the wrong Dane. Now you can go get your beer. See you, Mary. Who is Mary? Spanish girls are crazy pussies. That one. Please, he must be 15. Then that one. - He must be 100. - 100 just in his waist. - You're picky with all of them. - True, you can't be so choosy. Sorry, I just want someone normal, my age. Here comes one your age. And he's not bad at all. Can I change Dane for black in my list? - Either you kiss him or I will. - Or me, because his back looks even better. - No, I will. Shall I go? - Come on! - Excuse me! - Yes? - Go ahead. - The Palmar? - The Palmar? - Yes. It's some 60 kilometers away, in the way to Cadiz. - It's kind of far. - That way, right? Yes, that way. But far away. - Do you know the time? - Yes, it's 10 to... Is this possible? Girls, come on, hurry it up. - You'll be late for class. - This feels so good. Here. What is this wonder? You want to surf surrounded by hot guys with your bald head completely burned? - No. - Wear it now, the Sun is getting hot now. - It's gorgeous, I love it. - I want my cap too. No, sorry, swimming caps only for ladies with bald heads. - You're bullying me a bit. - We're the ones with cancer. What a pair. Take mine. But I want it back after class. - It's beautiful. - I love my cap! - Let's get out of here, man. - Right, let's go. - Hi. - Hi. - Who is Eva? - That's me. I am Eva. - I am Manu. - Nice to meet you. - I am Mar. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Did you ever surf? - No. We're virgins. Surf virgins. About the other thing, we are actually very experienced. - Particularly Eva. - None when it comes to surfing. OK. It's good to know. I'll get the gear. I'll be right back. Don't move. - OK, we'll be waiting here. - Do wait for me. Really, man? This is some coincidence. No, this is fate telling you you you should screw your surf teacher 3 times in a row. - 3? - When you go black... You never come back. Did you get waxed? Girls, welcome to your first surfing class. Before the warm-up... My mother bought this neoprene suit for me. - Here's your cap. - That's the way I like it. - How was surfing like? - Fuck surf. I need a beer. - Excuse me! Beer! - Where is Eva? She's really good at surfing, and good at the teacher, you won't believe who it is. - Who is it? - The black guy from yesterday! - This is fate making a signal, right? - And the good kind of signal too. What are you looking at? How long has it been since the last time you had a mammography? - I never had one. - That is so wrong, Mar. Best cure for cancer is early discovery. I see nothing wrong at first sight. But a doctor should check it. The moment we get back, I'll get you an appointment with the gynecologist. What is it? You never saw a woman touching another woman's boobs? - It's actually my first time. - And? Do you like them? - They're cute. - And they feel soft when you touch them. I'm told that a lot. Take your hand off now, girl. I'm getting turned on. That will pass when he gets old. - Well, I can't find anything. - That's your beer. I actually kind of liked it. - The school is yours? - Yes. I've had it for 3 years now. I also have a clothes shop in Seville. I am always traveling back and forth. - You're doing great then. - Well, I am always working. I can't complain, though. And you're a veterinarian. Not bad either. No, not bad at all. I can't complain myself. - 15 to 11. - I didn't ask what time it was. No? Oh, right, sorry. You're right. - You asked for it last night. - Who, me? You're mistaken. Are you sure? OK, it was me. But I can explain it. It's something weird, but I can explain. Well, then you can give me that weird explanation tonight over dinner. - You don't waste any time. - I don't. Life is too short to waste our time. - So, dinner together? - If we do have dinner, I'd have to tell you something. - You have a girlfriend. - Nope. - A boyfriend? - No. - What then? - Cancer. I'm bald. Hence the swimming cap. - You can still have dinner, right? - Sure. - What's the matter then? - Nothing's the matter. If nothing's the mater, then we'll go have dinner. It'll have to be a few days from now. I am leaving for Morocco tomorrow. It's a long story and really weird too. I'll tell you when I get back. The long weird story will make the wait worth it? I think so. It's worth a lot. What's up, honey? We are already at the camping lot, washing dishes now. The girls are happy, fulfilling their wishes. OK. I'll give you my report later. Eva, what's wrong? Why the long face? I just remembered my father. - Your father? - I already told you about him. He abandoned us right when my morn fell ill. I learned just the other day that he has a restaurant in Asilah. So, you said sleeping in the desert just to see him? I think so. But seeing him would be like forgiving him, and he doesn't deserve it. And then, I also think I wouldn't be able to. Eva, come on, it's your father. Yes, it's my father, a man who abandoned her daughter 20 years ago. That's my dad. Right. I think the best thing you can do is listening to your heart. You want to see him? Do. You don't want to? Then don't. But, if your first intention was to see him, there must be a reason. - You think so? - Yeah. I just dropped a piece of crap that looks like a baguette. - That's disgusting. - You are so vulgar. I don't know. I was born like this. But it's quarantined for real. Don't go in. What a chic place Paco booked for us. The glasses look like bath tubs. Good evening. Welcome to His pal Veget, I'm Tony, your guide in this extrasensory trip through all 5 senses. Fine, Tony. But, would you get some bread for us? I'm starving. - We don't have bread. - What's that mean? Mar, it's not a night club. It's a 1 Michelin star place. Sorry, she doesn't go out much. That's a lie. I do go out a lot. But I don't go to places like this. There is always a first time. Will you have some wine? - Yes, thank you. - Lots of it. What's the house wine? - We don't have house wine. - Come on, Tony. No bread and no wine? - What kind of shithole is this? - Excuse her. I'm sorry. Bring the wine list. Great. We have a large wine list and a Golden Nose sommelier. - He'll find the perfect match. - Thank you so much. - Man, behave yourself. - What's wrong? I like to dunk bread in wine. Call me weird. This pork is so good. - The portions are really light. - It's a tasting menu. - Well, you ever did a runner? - No, never. - But I always wanted to do it once. - Really? Your wish is my command, because I took your cards and cash. - And I didn't even bring my wallet. - What? That can't be true. - You're nuts. - We came to get crazy and live to the max. - I love how crazy you are. - Thank you. I don't find my cousin's crazy as amusing. - Everything OK? - Yes, very. Everything was delicious. - Didn't you say there was no bread? - There isn't. I bring this from home. - I love dunking bread. - I love it wet too. I mean the bread. Not the other thing. I'll leave you to dunking your... bread, not the other thing. Well... Man, he's crazy about you. - Of course, I'm very hot. - He's not bad himself. He isn't, right? But our love is impossible. - Once we do a runner. - Again? - What does it say, Eva? I can't see. - 388 Euro. This is very simple. You stand up and you leave. - There's nothing else to it. - Sure there is. - How was everything? - Really tasty. - So you liked my tasting menu? - Yes, it was very good. - You are the chef? - No, I'm the owner. But I give the chef his inspiration. And the Michelin star is mine. So the chef thinks he cooks the food and you stick it to us for 388 Euro. - Will you pay now? - No, not yet. How come? We're discussing the tip for the chef. He's the one that cooks. The inspiration, you cannot eat. I thought of bringing some shots on the house. - So kind of you. - But we just ran out. That was so rude. The moron is in the kitchen. So we stand up slowly now, like nothing is wrong. - If someone asks, we're going for a smoke. - OK. - OK? - OK. Slowly. Very slowly. What's the worst thing that could happen? RUNNER! Tony! Tony! Run, run! - What's wrong, boss? - They didn't pay! - I'm going, I'm going! - Catch them! - Hey, stop there! - Go, go! Tell my parents I love them. OK, OK. I give up. I am the criminal mastermind. - Why are you laughing? That's a fine? - No, I won't call the police. That's my phone number. In case you want to know places with bread and house wine. - Thank you so much. - Welcome. - But you'd come along for the dunking? - Yes, I'd love to have bread wet with you. That's the idea. That's why I followed you and I gave you my number. - Wait. I do want you to come. - You do? Great then. We'll go then. Give me a call. - By the way, I'm Mar. - Right, that was good thinking. I'm Tony. - That was silly. - Sure. Now I'll tell my boss I didn't catch you. I twisted my ankle. - I twisted my ankle. - It looks like you're rapping. - I twisted my ankle's rap. - Right. Well. Right. No, just a few weeks. I told you the other day. - Let me. - Wait a second. - What are you doing? - I said no Antonio! No more! - Are you done? - Yes. I wasn't talking to Antonio. That was my brother. My little muffin? How is he doing? I don't know. I was about to ask when some idiot tossed my cell down the hill. It was broken already. Look at the bright side. Now you won't be tempted to call bald Antonio. I don't want to call him. I want you to get me a new cell phone. - I'll get it when we go back. - I want the 1 thousand Euro iPhone! - Or 2 thousand. - In pearl white. - Pearl white. - And the headset. - You're some pearl. - Shut it or go get my phone back! - Girls, I'll go change the scarves. - Don't be late! - Michous. - You pronounce it mechouis. - But you have to make an order in advance. - There he comes. - So, from Spain? - Yes, and very hungry. Any advice? I would start with harira, a tasty soup. Then paste la. And a vegetable tagine for the end. Very good. It all sounds tasty. I'm persuaded. Your face sounds so familiar. I don't know why. I don't know. I don't know, child. I don't know. What's up, Ignacio? Fuck me. - Dad, won't you say Hi to your daughter? - Yes, yes. You're older. That's normal. When you leave your home, the ones that stay grow up. - How are you? - Fine. I've been better, but I'm fine. Now I'm great, having dinner with two close friends. I'll be right back. I thought you needed a little push. Asilah is pretty, right? Beautiful. When are you leaving? Dad, why didn't you go to the burial? Why? I was 20. I needed you. It wasn't easy. - I was in Argentina and... - And what? What is it with Argentina? There are no phones in Argentina? There are no planes? I tried to call you many times. I didn't know what to say. You didn't know either how to tell me you came here, to Asilah. A friend of yours told me. Right. Never mind. You don't need to explain. I've been alone all my life. I'm fine. - It's different now. - Different now? Why is it different now? Because I have the same disease that killed my mother? I've been fighting cancer for months now, father. I had surgery. I had chemo. I am bald now. I threw up. And here I am. In Asilah. If next week I'm told it is grown again, I'll keep on fighting. Hand in hand with Mar and Carmen. They are my real family. Then why are you here? I don't know. I don't know, dad. - How did you find his restaurant? - Paco helped me. It was easy anyway. Not that many lgnacios who own a restaurant in Asilah. - That's why you changed the scarves. - Right. This wasn't a good idea at all. - Give me the keys to the van. I'm going. - What happened? Nothing. I'm just going to the van. Give me the keys. - No, honey, you can't drive like this. - Give me the keys. - Don't ask. And give me the fucking keys! - Let's all calm down a bit. Carmen, I ask you to say nothing else. You've done more than enough. Let me pay and we go then. OK? Give me my bag. - We're not paying. Fuck his father. - The bag. One runner a week is enough. No! Fuck it, wait for me. Ignacio, she wants to fix things, but she doesn't know how. Give her time. That's also what I want. - But maybe this can't be fixed. - Everything can be fixed. Plus, you have something going for you. You're her father, she has no other family. - I wasn't a good father. - It's never too late. She came all the way down here because she needs you more than ever. Give her time. Thank you. What's wrong with it? - It still has gas left? - But of course it has gas! Man, you can't stop! Not now! What the fuck is wrong with this fucking van? - Eva, are you OK? - Yeah. No, I am not! I'm not OK! I'm not OK, my friend. This is bullshit! What are we doing here? What are we doing here? Tell me what we're doing. The trip, the van and my father. My father... I should be home with my pets, waiting to be told the results of the cancer I have in my body, my friend. I have cancer, for fuck's sakes! I don't want to die, my friend. I don't want to die, my friend! I don't want to die! I don't want to die. - Fuck, you scared us! - Get up! - Police, get up! - Didn't you want to go to jail? Not here. - That van is yours? - Yes. Why there? Don't you know forbidden to leave van in the road? Yes, but it broke down, and we have no cell reception. We're stranded. That's not my problem. I'll give you fine and take the van away. - You can't do that. - I can do that. I police. You not. - Look at that. - But you pay 500 €, I forget other thing. - Look at that. - Excuse me? - You're blackmailing us? - Yes, blackmail. Now 600 Euro. - Hey, it was 500. - Now 700. - You take van and go. - We're not paying a cent. This is illegal. - Fine. I take van. - No, you're not taking the van. No, let him take it, let him. Now, if these two die here, you're the culprit. - What die? Why die? - It's because of this. They have cancer. And this was their farewell trip. Hugging life one last time. But thanks to you we'll just die of thirst in the desert. - You really have cancer? - Man, they have quite a bit of cancer. - But you don't care. You're a bad person. - I am not bad person. I want money for... Know I'll help. He knows engines. We'll fix van and go. Come on. Ladies, I... I want to apologise for earlier. Asking for money is not good. I am so sorry. You fixed our van, Said. So, we forgive you. Thank you so much. And now, where you go? No clue. We were thinking of renting am SUV to drive on the seashore. Your car is an SUV, right? Yes, but it's police car. It can't be. What a shame. One of her last wishes was to see me driving an SUV on the sand. Yes, it was. Of course. I really wanted to see it. - But... If it can't be, it can't be. - Poor little thing. On top of having cancer, she won't see me driving an SUV on the beach sand. - She was so looking forward to it. - Right. - What about a little jump? - Slowly, please. - Easy now. - Everything is OK. This is my house. - It's so beautiful, Said. - All the land up to the tree, my house. - You have sheep. - And a rooster. - A donkey too? - My wife, Nazilla. - Nice to meet you. - And that's my daughter, Amira. Amira? That's such a beautiful name. It means princess, because she is my princess. Amira, I am Eva. Glad to meet you. She's gorgeous. I love your hair. God, please, this is so good! - Wonderful. - It's delicious. Said, thank your wife, please, for the scarves. She looks gorgeous. - Thank you. - Said, let me ask you something. - It may be none of my business. - Don't worry. I'm just curious. What exactly is that thing on Amira's face? What's the word? Warts. They started to grow like one year ago. But Moroccan HS says they won't treat because it's not life threatening. I have to go to private doctor, but very expensive. But I'll get the money. Because kids laugh at her in school. And she doesn't want to go to school. But she has to study to be independent woman. - Of course. - Right. That's why you asked us for money? - To cure Amira? - Yes, but I ask for forgiveness again. - My wife make cakes for you. - Thank you so much. - We got something too. - Right, yes. - Here we have 2100 Dirham and 790 Euro. - No! Yes. It's all our cash, but it should be enough for Amira's surgery. - The kid needs surgery now. - Tomorrow. I cannot take. It's lot of money. I cannot. Yes, you can, and you accept. So that Amira can smile on her way to school. Make her study, go to college. Get a degree. She has to be independent. She shouldn't depend on any man. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thanks to you. - I am a fan of your trip's philosophy. - Thank you so much. Also a fan of your list. But mostly your way of facing your... - Your disease. - Man, call it by name. It's cancer. - But it's... - I get it. It's not easy. But the best way to face it is to call it by its name. Cancer. - Cancer. - Cancer. Again. Cancer. - Cancer. - See it's not bad for you? The truth is I admire your strength and energy. I don't know that I could... Sure you could. There are two ways. Either you face it and keep it company, or you face it and it takes you away. So I chose to face it and keep it company. And enjoy my due every minute. Whatever life offers me. - I'll tell you one thing. - Go ahead. The present to you from life, you will love. - How are you doing? - Really well. Happy. Welcome to the cutest and cheapest spa in the world. - Those are rocks? - Everything is not what it seems. These rocks you bathe in mud and then you rub them on your body. - I think I got it. - Back there? Great, let's do it. - You can rub this on the face too? - Sure, but watch out for the mou... - War, war! - You motherfucker! What are you doing? Big eyes, stop reading and have a drink with me. Who do you think you are? Come on, give me my book back. Pretty and with a temper. Just the way I like them. - Are you alone? - I'm married, so don't bother. Well, if you don't tell your hubby there is no harm. Look, the first time I was diagnosed with cancer, my husband told our kids. And he looked after them as he washed my vomit away. And he would take me in his arms to bed when I couldn't move. Back then I told myself that true love is watching the person you love die. And now I wonder, who will watch you die? I definitely won't. So, next time you call my husband hubby, I'll tear your head clean off. - Look how fresh. - We need tuna and... clams. That smells so good. - Just a minute, just a minute. - What's wrong? - The art! It's ready now? You sure? - It is now. - It's all delicious. - I am actually a cook. I work the season as a waiter to save some money for a restaurant of my own. Let's hope so. Hurry up, because you are good at this. Eva, what's wrong, why the silence? Nothing's wrong. I'm thinking of my mom. She cooked this dish often when I was a kid. My dad called it spaghetti with music. That's a great name, spaghetti with music. Why don't you use it for your restaurant? I will when I set it up. I want no copyright lawsuits later. Since we're talking restaurants, I'd like to buy you all a farewell dinner tomorrow. - But we're paying, Mar. - You kill a dog... Tony, tell me what the best place here in Tarifa is to eat local fish and vegetables. I like Casa Huelchi a lot, but I can't go, I have a wedding. I'm not getting married, don't look at me like that. I'll be working. Good evening. We are cousins to the bride. - Your tables are 5 and 2. - OK, so 5 and 2. - Hi. Good evening. How are you doing? - Hello. The bride and groom looked gorgeous. You're doing fine? - I am fine. - That's what matters. - You? - I'm doing great. - You seem a little nervous. - I am the only black man. - Chill, we'll be fine. - OK. - Look at that hot guy over there. - Wow. - He's coming our way. - Right. He's sitting next to you. - Hell-o. - My name is Karl. - I am Mar. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I'm Carmen, glad to meet you. And, where are you from, Karl? I'm Danish. I'm so sorry. So very sorry. - Don't worry. Relax. - I swallowed the wrong way. I'm fine. It's always the same. In every wedding they want to sneak some people in. You know what? I'll charge 150 Euro per person. Smart-asses. I'm the one with a Michelin star. I laugh at Roca, Crest a and Adrian. It's Adriá. It is, is it? Shut up and go back to work. What are you doing? - I wanted to thank you. - What for? Well, for being here with me. I loved everything that happened the last few days. But your present was the one I loved most. - More than sleeping in the desert? - Not really more. It was different. Really, it connected me with beautiful things. You made me remember why I chose to be a veterinarian. - Really? - Yeah. You want the story? - Please. - Do you know...? - These two are not familiar at all. - I don't, no. Remembering important things. For instance, when I was 7 my parents took me to a ranch. I'm sorry for interrupting, but I think the bride is on to us. - Which way is she coming? This way? - Yes, that way. - Then we're going this way. - Runner. You take the bottle. Take the bottle. - Fate is always random. - Why? Because you wanted a Dane, so fate brought the cutest Dane in the universe. But now you like Tony, and you're not so eager to fuck a Dane. Am I right? - What's this? - I made it myself. That gravy is delicious and this bread is quite fresh, so I made it. I baked it and added some cereal. You know... I'm so sorry. He's strong. I'm going. We're really busy. By the way, you look beautiful. - Who is this? - A friend, Tony. - Why did he bring you bread? - Well... Mar? - You're not Ton! - I can be whoever you want me to be. - Valentin, take this to table 8. - OK, OK. That kiss was for me? - Let's go. - I have to keep working. - We're gonna have sex. - Let's go then. Stop looking for her. She's with Tony. You got nothing to do. I don't get why she left with him. I'm more handsome and romantic. - So, conceited and romantic? - I am known as the Danish Romeo. - But Romeo wasn't romantic. - The most romantic literary character. No way, you're wrong. I'll tell you why. You know why Romeo would go to Juliet's balcony every night? It wasn't because he was in love. He wanted to get laid. But Romeo was smart. He knew if he went and said, 'Juliet, let me get inside you', he would get nothing. That's why he used rhymes and poems. He wasn't romantic. He was just horny. - I'll tell you then, right? - Please. When I was a kid, we spent a weekend at some friends of theirs'. One night, a mare went into labor. My father took my hand and we ran to see the birth. I was utterly in shock. Imagine. I didn't understand anything but I thought it was a miracle. That was magic. And I asked my father who the man was that was helping the animal. And he said it was a veterinarian, a doctor for animals. And I said with a serious face, 'Dad, now I know when I grow up I want to be an oterinarian'. What a surprise! Isn't this the lady who doesn't pay her bills in restaurants? How are we doing? - Who is this? You know him? - No, first time I ever see him. - You think I'm an idiot? - You don't really look very smart. So, you are a thief and also a smart-ass? That's fine, really fine. Good evening. Could you send a patrol to the Maestranza estate? Robbery. Yes. Thank you so much. What, no more jokes? Look, I don't like police. I go. Bye, hero. - Wait, wait! - Everything OK? Wait, I need to know about you or I will feel like a slut. - You have siblings? - Two, Alma and Alvaro. I'm the youngest. Feeling less slutty? No, no. I still feel like a slut. - What's your family name? - Rasmussen Ramón. - As a kid I was called weirrd. - What is Rasmussen? - It's my family name. - Why is it foreign? I am a bit of a foreigner. My father is Danish and my mother is from Málaga. Wait a minute! Are you saying you're Danish? A bit. I was born in Copenhagen, but I was already in Fuengirola when I was 5. - You speak Danish? - Yes, not a lot, but I can get by. - Say something in Danish. - What do you want me to say?
