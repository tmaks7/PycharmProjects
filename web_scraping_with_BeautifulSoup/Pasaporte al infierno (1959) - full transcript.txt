I'm putting down the speed, 'cause on this job we're working to the clock. Or is it because you don't have any respect for the customers? Could be. But with 20,000 cases of cigarettes on board, I've got a lot of respect for our investment. You know Pete, if Tony's got everything lined up, there's no reason why we shouldn't be in and out of the harbour in an hour. Hey you can't do that. Why not? Remember Lola? She's expecting me. Hey now look boy you're gonna have to forget all about that for a while remember that. Do you want one? Yes, please. The trouble with you is that you have no love life. With 40,000 bucks waiting to be picked up, I can't afford it. Hello Tony, is everything alright? Hello Tony. There's nothing to worry about. Let's get started. He's safe for an hour. Okay, let's go. Come on, come on. Lem. Open up. Alright men get stuck into it. We have no time to waste. Well we had a good trip, Tony. How on Earth did you manage to square the customs? Oh you know the old mixture of blackmail and bribery. I've got to hand it to you boy. Hey Tony, how about a drink? Suits me. It would appear that you have had an easy run. Smooth as silk. Say that's good stuff. How about getting me a little. That could be arranged. Now how many boxes have you brought me over? 1000 as promised. How much money have you got? 40,000 as agreed. Ah, the old cat and mouse act, eh? I like you Tony, you're a nice guy. Is it all there? Why, don't you trust me? No. Count it. Don't worry, I will. Have you got the Corsican run laid on? Sure it is. The money's ready to be picked up, as soon as the next cargo's loaded. It's up to you. Well when have you got the report? I say, what have you got the report, eh? Hello, hello? I only wanted to tell you that there is a body, of a murdered man, lying on the beach. What? What's that, a body, what's that you're talking about? Is this some kind of a joke, who are you? I say, who are you, come on, give me your name, hello? My dear friend, you really must be in a terrible state today. I've called you, I've been more interested in the identity of the body, than who I am. I'm warning you, my friend... Ah, goodbye. But this is terrible. You don't speak to the police like that. I have no time for pompous, bad tempered police man. Let them do their own dirty work. Hey, you forgot on the phone. Ah, let it ring. Adios. Adios. Come on, Beauvet, we have got work to do. You've certainly got yourself fenced in up here. You're on a bridge with moat, and rug boat. We got your bream here, you'll see nothing, see? Okay, I've got this hooked up. The hunt's still on for Brant, and the girl. Cliver wants us to look for them. Ah, I'm glad to see you, Senor Mencini. You can drop the formal stuff, flavour. Call me Tony. Alright, alright, calm down, I'll not waste words. I'm in need of your services. Strangely now that had occurred to me. I hardly thought you had brought me up here to play gin rummy. A man who is essential to my organisation has disappeared, I think perhaps, you can assist us in getting him back. They tell me there was a killing somewhere up the coast. Have you heard anything about it? Lets just say a man helped them who has now paid for that folly. What makes you think that I can do better, than you bunch of a strong armed boys? You can't, we just want you to use your brains to put us under them. Oh, I see. And how do you propose I do this? These people have no papers of identity. To leave this country without a passport is not easy, the only way is to use one of the less orthodox, or shall we say, underground routes. You, Tony, are a specialist in the unofficially sanctioned entries, and exits from these happy, sun kissed shores. How can you be sure I will try? Such an error as that, Tony, will have a detrimental effect on your health. Like shooting me in the back, eh? Oh no, no. We'd have to think of something much more artistic and subtle for you. But you needn't worry about Tony. He's not a bad guy, and he knows better than Matt. Carl, get Senor Tony $2,000. We'll not require a receipt. How do you identify this man and the girl? Carl will show you some pictures, and give you all the information we've got on Professor Brant, and his daughter, and don't forget. We shall expect some quick results. That all depends on when they decide to come out of hiding. Fine, fine. Please, taxi! Oh, please, please, help me. Please, you must help me. What's the problem? Those men are after me, you must stop them. Get on the boat. Hey, Pete! Hey wait a minute you two, where do you think you're going? Hold it. Hey! I got him. Glen, Jake, come on. Cast off, lets get out of here. Well young lady, looks as though we gotta take you along with us. What's the trouble? Thank you both for stopping those men. Who were they? First let me introduce myself. I'm Ms. Brant. - Hello. - Hello. You better call me, Anna. My papa is in trouble with the police, and other people, and we were hiding till a friend could get us out of the country. Those men weren't the police, or were they? They belong to a gang of currency manipulators. Their leader is a man called Cliver. They kidnapped my father, and are trying to get me too. Why do they want him? My father's an engraver. Before the war he was the finest in Austria. These men are making counterfeit American dollars, don't you see, he's invaluable to them.. Oh I get it, they're forcing your father to do their dirty work. He was in their hands until Anton arranged his escape. He had the plan for us to get us out of the country. But now they have caught him. I just know they have caught him. Now Cliver, tell me. What have you done with my daughter, and Anton? Of that I know nothing. But your friend, Anton, will not be able to help you escape again. He should've known better. I hope you realise now here, Brant, that any future attempts to get away will be futile. Your daughter's safety depends entirely on your willingness to cooperate with us. Tell me what you want, and I will do it. Now that's very much better, you're beginning to see some sense. See that Professor Brant has everything that he requires. At least, within reason. What do you make of it, Bob? I don't know. I don't know how we can help her. There's nothing we can do until we can find out what trouble she's in. But what are we gonna do with her? We've got a job of work to do, we can't leave her in Tangiers. So what, lets take her with us. Wait a minute, this is the Corsican man, don't you think it's a bit risky? For us, or for her? For all of us. I don't like women mixed up with business. Give her a break man, she's a nice kid. Then we can sort things out when we get back. Okay, Pete, we'll see what she says to that. Hello there. You feeling any better? Hi, how long have I been asleep? Oh, about 16 hours. We didn't wanna disturb you. Did you see me asleep? Yeah, we took a peep in. You look beautiful. How about some food? I think Pete must have something going by now, lets take a look. Jake, come here, come over here. Good morning, miss. Good morning. Hey, you take over the wheel. And keep it on that course. Ay-yi, Skipper. Good morning, Anna. Good morning, Tom. Hey, the name's Peter. Peeping Tom, from what I hear. You notice Pete's on a diet. He's down to only about six meals a day now. Like that? Oh, bigger than that. One has to keep up one's strength, you know. Spring is here. Anna... Pete and I have been talking things over about you and your father. And about me being aboard, and interfering with your business? Please. Let me stay with you, and help you to... Work the boat. Well, if that's the way you want it, when we get back we'll find your father. I suppose you've been coming to Tangiers for your materials, for some time. Yeah, our luck has been better than most. Oh Bob, why don't you give it up? Then what, if anything, happens to me, does it matter to you? In a way, yes. Oh, in what way? Look. There's Peter. Hey, you look all burned up. I'm all burned up alright. What's the matter? What's the matter, take a look at that. Counterfeit. Phoney? Wait till I get my hands... Oh, wait till you get your hands on Tony. Do you think this man Tony has anything to do with Cliver? - Cliver? - Is the fella that's got your father? He's a top lining guido, isn't he? I should've thought of that. Who is this man, Tony? Well he's an agent, a receiver of our goods. What about the Corsican trip? Well load it up, can't leave her in Tangiers. Tony's always been straight with us. If we're gonna get out, lets get out now. Bob, we're getting close to the coast. Thanks. I'll come up in a minute and give you a hand. Can I help? No, no, no. I want you to stay here. If anything goes wrong up top, I don't want you there. We're getting close to our contact point. Take care of yourself, darling. No sign of a signal yet either. Don't worry about that. Anna, there's some hot coffee on the stove, help yourself. Thanks, I will. And give me a shout if there's anything I can do. We started a light ahead. Okay, now you stay right here, and don't worry about a thing. It's time, give them the signal. They caught him in. Looks as though we're expected. They dare not drag it out, get down! Take him below. I've gotta get out of here. How is it Bob? Oh, not bad, considering. It's a nasty cut, it could have been a lot worse. Take it easy, everything's okay up top. We're heading back. You know, I don't like what I smelled. Who do you think is flaming us? Tony. What makes you so sure? I know his type. Got any proof? Well, no, but I'll bet I'm right. Oh, he'll have plenty to answer for when I get my hands on him. Hello Cliver. How's it going Tony? Allow me to congratulate you on your efficiency. You have all the necessary information for interception. They missed the Corsica trap, so from now it's up to your Carl, to pick them up. Don't worry about that. He's an expert in these matters. Well your friends from Tangiers will not find it easy to elude Carl. His boat is fast, and well equipped with radar. He'll need to be. Hijacking the rent, I won't be any pushover. You're concerned about the cargo? Naturally, I want it. You will get the cargo, Tony. How about something when it comes? Very well. I'll give you another 4,000, how's that? That will do. Come on now. You really must excuse me, Tony, I'm very busy. Message from the Medina. They've sighted the Ventura. Now you understand what to do? Remember, I don't want any firing, unless it's absolutely necessary. Stay here, and keep undercover. He's still with us, could be a runner. Coming up fast. Quick Jake, you take over the wheel. Okay. You're not well enough, I'll handle this matter myself. Captain, there's a boat heading straight towards us. Looks like a runner. It might be a customs boater, I'd better take a look. But I... Bob, you mustn't get up. Swing her hard over, Jake. I don't know what these cakers are up to. Don't forget, the good cut for you when the job's done. I think I'd better go up and see what it's all about. What are they after? Our cargo, probably. Heave to, I want to come aboard, and talk to you. What do you want? I'll tell you when I come aboard. I have a message from Corsica. They're going alongside to board. Come on, give it to me. Open this door. Come on, open up. Your friends can't help you now. Get an axe, on the double. Hey you, come over here. Get this hatch off, and get the stuff out. Alright, leave it to me. So, we have the pleasure of meeting once again. Your father will be glad to know that we found you. Where is my father? Don't worry, he's well and working hard. Joe. Soy. Get her out of here. Let go of me. Alright men, get cracking, moving that cargo. Emilio! Get over here, get this girl aboard. - Alright, get in there. - Don't push! Go on, get moving. Hold on. Everything alright? Si, senor. Good work. Were you frightened I wouldn't get here? Nice work, Carl, did you get the girl too? Of course, that's what we went for. We have the cargo as well, as promised. What happened to the boat, and the others? It worries you? In a way, yes. Lets say they will be out of action for a long time. You, bring the girl up. We'll get the girl away from here. There is my car. You are welcome to use it if it will help. Well that's good of you, Tony. Leave me alone. Come on, get up on that dock. Make way there. Hey, stop her! Get her, you! Come on, we'll get a boat. There is one down there. But no shooting, we want her alive. Hey, hey. Come round, please, come here. Come on, Ms. Brant, I won't harm you. Who are you? Well sometime I'm something, some other time... Well, isn't important. But how do you know my name? Oh question, question, you're worse than the police. What do you know about the police? Enough to know that you can't stay like this. You must find some dry clothes. So let me take you to a little place that I know. Come on, there's nothing to fear, love. Let me introduce you. Ms. Brant, you meet Beauvet. Beauvet, Ms. Brant. Now, come to here, and I will push you. But I'm alright, I can walk. But you're cold, you need a rest. Come on, Beauvet, here we go. Lovely girl. Fleek? Achika, would you like five pesetas? Please, senorita. Come on. Look through there. Do you see that boat coming in? Si, si. Will you take a letter for me to el capitain, Senor Dankan. Si, si. Come on. Excuse me, have you a piece of paper? I have a pencil. There. Here are your five pesetas. Thank you. Where is the girl? She tell me if you come back she has go up to tippy tower. Oh. Many thanks for the frou, was very kind. I'll go up and see her. You've been waiting a long time, Ms. Brant. You gave me a start, but I am so pleased to see you. Why? To thank you for your help, and the money you gave that to that kind lady. Oh, everything. How can I repay you? Perhaps you misunderstand me, my dear lady. I might have ulterior reasons. I don't understand you. That ring. Where did you find it? Oh, the ring. It's very strange, isn't it? Something I pick up in my travels. But it belonged to Anton. Anton, I thought that was his name. But, where's Anton now? He's dead. No, I didn't kill him. I have my reason to keep this ring, but I won't depress you with detail. Wait. Where can I find you? You can't, but I will find you. Anna! Oh, I thought you'd never come. We came as soon as we got your note, honey. Hey now, wait a minute, let me take a look at her. Hey. Oh, I look dreadful. Doesn't she look great? Not to me. Hey, come on, lets find a place to talk, huh? Put me down, you big ape. Not until you kiss me. You must excuse us. Lola, I'd like you to meet, Ms. Brant. Lola, Anna. - Hello. - Hello. Sit down, Bob, and tell me all your news. Please sit down. Well we ran into a bit of trouble. Oh, police? No, Tony double crossed us. I never liked that man. Let me have that. Anna will tell you about her troubles. They link up with ours. If you don't mind me saying so, my dear, you look a little... How do you say? Worse for wear. But we'll soon fix that. Anna's had a tough time. We want you to look after her, until we get back. Get back, but you've only just come. And it's been such a long time. I know darling, but we've got something important to do, and it just won't wait. I don't understand. Our boat was hijacked. Hijacked? Did you lose everything? Well not everything, but enough. Anna will tell you about it later. Oh, alright. Where are you going now? To find Tony before he hears we're back in circulation. Oh, okay. Take care of yourself, darling. Don't worry, I'll look after Bob. Don't be long, darling. We'll be right back. We'll have a drink, and then I'm sure I can find you something to wear, come on. Well, I'll slip back and give Glen a hand, and then settling our account with the Medina. I don't get it. Don't tell me you forgot that limp of mine. Blimey, you're not gonna use that? Why not? I don't mind. But don't you think the treatment's a little bit drastic? Oh boy, this is gonna be the biggest bang of the year. Certainly will be. Okay, good luck. When I answered the door, four men rushed in, and dragged Anna away. There was nothing I could do to stop them. Stay where you are, and I'll be right over. We'll go and pick Pete up, at the Green Spider. We'll get things sorted out from there. You weren't stopping in town, I'll bet you're surprised to see me. Clearly. Quit stalling, Tony. You and I got a few things to settle. How did the Corsica run go? You tell me. Who tipped off the patrols, hijacked our boat, and for good measure, kidnapped Ms. Brant? I don't know what you're talking about. And what do you get out of it, huh? Let me go. Okay, but you're coming with me. No, you don't! You'll be sorry for this. We gotta find a quiet place to make this rat talk. I think you dropped this. Grab him! Come here, you rat, come here! Hold it. Good girl, Lola. Get in the car, we'll continue where we left off. Where does your friend Cliver hang out? Come on, talk man. Have I got to beat it out of you, or are you gonna talk? Alright, stop, I'll talk. Now you're being sensible. At the Torres Maliga Penza. Yeah, I know the place. I'll square things with you, how much will you take? $50,000 should do it. But I haven't got time to get that money. I'm fed up with him. Get him in the car. Up, come on up. Up. Let me welcome you to Torres Maliga. You'll find it's not so easy to leave, as it was to get in. Tell me, what brings you here. So you're Cliver? Yeah. But it's of little interest to you, for you'll not be able to tell your friends of our meeting. In case you're interested, that was your boat, the Medina. The Medina, impossible. Every heard of a limpid bomb? Get them out of here, you know what to do. I'll take care of them. Come on, move. You're going to be drowned, tonight. And in case you're interested, this is how we're gonna do it. Come here, you! Okay then, get out. Come on boys, we haven't got all night. Hey Juarez, come here. Okay, Cliver, I wanna know where Anna and her father are. You nearly broke up my back. Get down then. Now quit stalling, tell me where Anna is. Time is short, where is she, now tell me, or I'll kill you! The boys say it's okay, we drown the big fellow tonight. But the girl, she's different. We drown her some other time. Get back to your work. All of you, on with the job. Carl! Okay, Pete. Put your hands up, get up there, get around, turn around. Now go on. Get up against the wall. Professor Brant, I presume. We have a little business to attend to. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Yes, I know what you are doing, but tell me where the plates are. So you know? Yes, I know, where are they? Here they are. They forced me to do it, by threatening to kill my daughter. I do hope she's alive. We'll soon know. Very well. Come on now. Are you taking them away? Yes, I take them away. Come on, we have no time to lose. Do you know this person, say who you are. I'm Joseph Brant. Come over here. Come on. Is Peter alright? Last time I saw him he was enjoying himself. Are you sure he's alright? I heard a lot of shooting coming from that house. Come and sit down, come along. Who are you? What are you doing here, my dear? Go on, get moving, Cliver. Peter! Lola! Everything okay Lola? Everything is fine. Hi, Lola. Father! Father! Go on, get in there. Well I think your transportation problem has solved. How did you know they were coming? Bless you miss, what do you think that I stay 20 years in the police for? I can see from your expression you hardly believe that I'm a police officer. Well you don't look like one. Oh that's true. And Anton's ring, led me to Cliver's gang. Look out! They're getting away! Wait for me! Lord heavens. Lord heavens. Oh Bob, why don't you give up the boat? Okay, whatever you say goes. Right, Pete? Well, you're the boss. Oh, Beauvet. L'amour, l'amour.
