Hey. Who's this? I already told you. It's your new boyfriend. How did you get this number? You gave it to me in the chat room. Well, I don't give my number out in chat rooms. So I know this is you, Marcus. And I wanna let you know you're real whack for trying to scare me. Really funny, babe, you almost got me. Got you? What are you talking about, babe? Really funny, Marcus. I know it was you. Me doing what? Chatting me and then calling me from some random number. The deep voice was actually kind of sexy. Babe, are you drinking already? The party isn't for another hour. Hello? Babe? Well, if it isn't you, then somebody's playing on my phone. First, they were sending me private messages in the chat and then they started calling me with this weird voice. Really? What did they say? Nothing really. They're just playing on my phone. I warned you about them chat rooms. There's creepy people in there. I wouldn't trip, though. You're just being paranoid. Probably Jared and his nerdy friends. -Just ignore it. -Yeah, you're right. It's stupid. Anyway, I'll just see you when I get there. I can't wait to see you, babe. api.OpenSubtitles.org is deprecated, please implement REST API from OpenSubtitles.com Hey, you. Jared, you're caught. Marcus told me it was you. Look, I know you're mad that you didn't get invited to the party, but it's not my fault that you're such a loser. Now stop calling me. Jared, stop playing on my phone. This isn't Jared. It's your new boyfriend. Please, just leave me alone. Oh, are you breaking up with me already? I said leave me alone or I'm gonna call the police. Really? And what are you gonna tell them? Oh, Mr. Policeman, somebody's calling me. I told you to leave me alone! You hang up on me one more time and I will wrap that blue around your neck, and it will be the last phone call you'd ever get. Scared yet? Yes, I'm scared now. Please just leave me alone. Oh, I can't leave you alone. I'm just starting to have fun. Come outside. I wanna see you. Don't worry, I don't bite. The police are on their way! You're going to jail! Well, I'm calling them now. You know I probably never check this, but leave a message anyway. Marcus, please, come over here. I don't think it's Jared. Please, just come over here. I think someone's in the house. 911, what's your emergency? There's someone in the house. First, he was prank calling me. Now he's chasing me. He's trying to kill me. Please help me. Where are you in the house? I'm in my upstairs bedroom. Please hurry. Please hurry. - Help is on the way. - Please help me. - Please help me. - Stay calm. -Help is on the way. -Please help me. Please! Please! Detective has arrived on the scene. Copy that. -Nelson, Gibson. -What are we looking at? Well, we got a 911 call around 11:00 PM last night about a break-in and a prank call. Is this our copycat guy? We think so. He may be at it again. Trina Davis was the victim. Young teenage girl. First got the call, then the kill, just like the movies. These damn kids nowadays trying to recreate old classic horror films. What happened to the good old days when a movie was just a movie? Gibson, criminals nowadays wanna be the characters in the movies they watch. Everyone wants to be famous, and they'll do whatever it takes. A lot of wackos out there, makes me sick to my stomach. Hmm. -Murder weapon? -No, ma'am. She got beat to death. Definitely him, then. - Officer Montedad. - Yes, sir. Thank you. We'll take it from here. All right, sir. Call Johnson and you get him -down to the station. -Okay. The copycat killer. That's what the news and media calls this guy. And he preys on women who are home alone. Now, um, this all takes place in a chat room. And in this chat room, this is how he picks his prey. And somehow, he talks them into giving up their address. Then bang, he prank calls them, hunts them down, and kills them. All right. So how do we find this guy and stop him before he claims his next victim? You know, that's the million dollar question. Well, then, you all need to come up with a million dollar answer. Yes, sir. What's this guy's motive? Hmm. Let's see. Let's look at the facts. It's not sex because he hasn't raped anyone. Now, there's other motivating factors when it comes to serial murders. It's, uh, financial gain, thrill-seeking, anger, and just someone looking for some goddamn attention. Well, we definitely know for a fact that this guy is seeking attention. Uh, so none of these girls are connected. This guy's smart. Yeah, but I would like to think that we're smarter. So let's put some effort into finding this guy before he kills again. I will start by looking into this chat room a little deeper. I'm on it. Right away, sir. I'll be in my office. Hi. How can I help you? A little bumpy, isn't it? Oh, it's just a little wind pocket, because we're landing. There's nothing to worry about. I'm sorry. I don't know why I still get so nervous on flights. I mean, I've flown all over the world and yet nothing has ever happened. I guess it's the fact that I'm not in control of my own destiny, that bothers me. Just relax. We'll be landing soon. Yeah. You know, my wife used to tell me I talk too much when I get nervous. There's this one time we were going to Hawaii and, uh, you know, my wife and I went this... when she was... um... that's when my wife was... look, uhh, I'm sorry. -I'm so sorry. -It's okay. Hey, hey. It's gonna be okay. Turbulence is nothing to be scared of, Keith. You know, you're more likely to get hit by a bus than die in a plane crash. You do realize we have to take a bus back to the terminal once we land, right? Thanks for giving me more to worry about. You know, what you should be worrying about is your 6:00 AM Zoom conference tomorrow. Why? Um, because every time you survive a flight, you end up showing me just how happy you are to be home. -Hmm. -Hmm. All night long. Hmm. Look, who's nervous now? Nervous is not the word I would use. Thanks, baby. You always know how to relax me. I don't know what I would do without you. This is your captain speaking. We are about to make our final descend into New Jersey, so, um, please fasten your seatbelts and prepare for landing. Hey, sweetie, I just landed in New Jersey. The weather is so crazy here. I don't even know if I'm gonna get a flight out tonight. Fingers crossed. I'll keep you posted. Call me when you get this. Excuse me, miss, but do you have any information on the flight delay? I'm so sorry, Mr. Mitchell, there's no new information yet. Uh, I guess that was the information you were looking for. I'm so sorry. Oh, if your plane doesn't leave tonight, we can book you in a hotel and you're more than welcome to stay in the airport in case something opens up. -Thank you. -Of course. You have a good day. ♪ Gotta go alone on this new day ♪ ♪ Gotta get it fresh like a new day ♪ ♪ I can smell the money from a mile away ♪ ♪ I gotta get it right right, right away ♪ -♪ Get it right ♪ -♪ Get it right ♪ ♪ Get it right ♪ ♪ Get into the back just to get it right ♪ -♪ Get it right ♪ -♪ Get it right ♪ -♪ Get it right ♪ -♪ Get it right ♪ ♪ Get into the back just to... ♪ What happened to your mother would never happen to you.

Let's go, one, two. One, two. One more time. Jab cross, jab kick. Come on. Come on. Hands up, baby. Come on. What's wrong? No. I need a break. It's not time yet. Let's go. I'm tired. Like, I know you don't want what happened to mom to happen to me, but you're doing too much. Baby, I'm just trying to get you right. By taking your anger and frustration out on me? Look, I know you think it was your fault. But let's face it, Dad. She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I shouldn't have to pay for that and neither should you. You're right. She was at the wrong place at the wrong time. If I was there, -I would have been... -Dad. Nobody blames you. I do, baby. I do. Your mother didn't know how to defend herself. And I'll be damned if something's gonna happen to you and you can't defend yourself. Understand? Yeah. I do. Fifteen more minutes. Jab cross, jab kick. Come on. Hey, Dad? Hey, sweetie. So, uh, it went from a two-hour delay to just plain delayed. I don't even know when I'm gonna get out. The weather is just crazy, so don't wait up. I'm not even sure when, uh, they're gonna open up lights again. Well, Dad, that's just too bad that you're gonna have to miss the house party I'm throwing tonight. Very funny. I guess it's just me and old Anky, then. Well, it's your last day, so you should be excited. I'd be more excited if I was going to the bonfire with the rest of my friends, instead I'm stuck on house arrest. Well, sweetie. You did give that girl a concussion, what do you expect? She talked about mom. Look, sweetie, losing your mother was tough on both of us. Still no excuse to fight. It's no excuse, but it is the entire reason why you taught me how to fight. No, no, I taught you to fight to protect yourself, not to go beating up anybody who talks about your mother. She got what she deserved. Don't say that. I learned my lesson, okay? I'm not gonna fight anymore unless to protect myself, especially if that means I have to be stuck in this house like a prisoner. Well, it could be worse. You could be in a six by eight cell with no light. I get it, Dad. But fighting is what I do. Not as a means of communication, young lady. True. So it's dark on the East Coast, right? Yes. Dark, rainy, and then annoying. And then don't think that I didn't notice you just changed the subject on me. God, I hate flying. I know, Dad, but you're gonna be okay. Just let me know before your flight takes off. - I love you. - It's your friend who needs Jesus. Go let her in and I'll talk to you later. Alexis, I know you see me. You better open up this door before I show your sexy dad all of these goods. This girl is crazy. Front door. Girl, when are you gonna realize I'm gonna be your mama? You do know you're only 17, right? I'm gonna be 18 in a couple of days, then I'm gonna be with your daddy. -Oh, okay. -You'll be calling me stepmom. No, I'm not. -It's gonna be crazy, right? -No. On the left. Dang, y'all never got nothing in your refrigerator. We're going shopping tomorrow. Anything else you wanna complain about in the house you don't live in? And can you please stop with the jokes about my daddy? That is so disgusting and irritating. Yeah, well, the best friend's job is never done if you're not irritated. Uh-hmm, well, then, you're definitely my best friend. So you're really not coming to the bonfire tonight? Oh, girl, unless the bonfire is on my own lawn, then no. Can't you just cut that little thing off or something? Oh, this? - Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure. Just right here and then the police will be here in 20 minutes to arrest me. It's only one day left, that should be the exception. The exception was me not going to jail. - And that part. - Dang, girl, I knew there was something I wanted to tell you. Did you hear about that girl over the news? Tess, there's hundreds of girls on the news. Can you be more specific? Yeah, there's this crazy man who beat this girl to death. It was all over The Gram. Oh, my dad made me delete IG off my phone as a form of punishment. Hmm. Yeah, they're saying he's some type of copycat killer, going around killing women when they're home alone. - That's crazy. - Yeah. He's probably looking for his next victim right now, so you better be careful in this outside all by yourself. Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself, but I'm worried about you. Gosh. You ain't got to worry about me, - I'm getting - Oh, it's like that? - Yeah. - Must be nice. I was just gonna light this bonfire and pretend that I was there with y'all. Girl, that's boring. Come do it in the real life. So what? - Ooh, I know there is something I wanna tell you before you go. You know Diana? - Uh-hmm. -And Michael? - Uh-hmm. - Girl, you ain't gonna believe what they've been up to. Well, is she thotting again? - Girl, you know she is. - Oh, gosh. Flight 104 from New Jersey to Los Angeles now boarding. Hey, Dad. Hey, sweetie, looks like I'll be coming home after all. Plane is boarding and we should be taking off in about a half an hour. That's perfect. So you'll be home tomorrow. You need me to come and pick you up? No. The company I met with is arranging an SUV for me. Ooh, excuse me, Mr. Fancy. Well, your daddy gets down like that. Whatever, Dad, you're corny. Oh, your little nasty friend don't think I'm corny. Oh, you saw that, huh? Yes, I did, and tell Tessa to stop with that. I'm twice her age and plus I got with her mom in high school. Probably told her too much. Ugh, Dad, that's disgusting. Just call me before you take off, okay? -I love you. -I will.

That eyewitness that puts the black Ford at Trina's house hours before she was murdered? Uh-hmm. And what about at the time of the murder? At the time of the murder, that same eyewitness says the car wasn't there. But you ready for this? A street cam puts that same car about a block away from the house from the hours of 1:50 and 2:20 AM. Hmm. That sounds really interesting. Is there any surveillance footage? -I'm already working on it. -Uh-hmm. This is our guy. I need that surveillance footage right away. It's done. This is, um, Sarah Gutierrez. She's the one that got away, right? Yes, sir. We should bring her in for questioning. Right away, sir. FBI might come in handy after at all. Uh-hmm. All right, brother. All right. Getting close, man. What was that? Hello? Hello? Hello? Anybody there? Hello? Hello? Oh, my God! Chris, baby, are you okay? I will be. Now, I see how you gave that chick a concussion. How did you get in anyways? I should have heard the alarm. Your dad let me in. He should have called me. I could have killed you. I know, but I wasn't gonna let my baby spent the night alone while all our friends go to the bonfire. I mean, what kind of man would I be? I made the banner myself. You like it? Aw, it's so sweet. I love it. Thank you, baby. -You didn't have to do that. -No problem. I wanted to. I wasn't gonna let you be the only one -that miss the bonfire. -Hmm. -Thank you. -Uh-hmm. - It's so cute. - You like it? I love it. You know, my dad's flight got delayed, so he won't be home until tomorrow. I know, he told me that. And he told me I can leave by 9:00. But he can see when I leave, so if I don't leave by 9:00, - he gonna call my dad. - Oh, my God. My dad is so extra. Well, at least we got a couple of hours to chill. Not so bad. But that is so good. Hmm. What about your little ankle thing? Won't it, like, go off or something? As long as I'm in the house, no, it won't go off. Well, can you go outside? How many times do I have to tell you? Yes. As long as I'm within a hundred feet of the tracker, which is in the kitchen on the Wi-Fi. What if the power is out and the Wi-Fi is not working? It has a backup system that sends the signals to the police. So basically there ain't no way to trick this little baby. So... if I wanna get a little freaky on the front porch, we could? You're crazy, but yes, nasty. I think I could get about as far as the mailbox. But if I'm out of range, the red light flashes. And I have about 10 seconds to get back before it sends an alert to the police. Wow. That's super detailed. I didn't know that. But it's my last day, so we're good. Hmm. What are you planning? To get rid of Chloe. Of course, I have to drug and rape you, because you're such a good little boy. I knew you were too good of a boy. You're gonna watch this? -No. -Can't you see, William? This was all out of love. No, no, no. I can't watch it. - I can't watch it. - No, I can't watch it. No! Ahh! Just leave it at the door. Thank you. You better go get that door. Front door. The snacks have arrived. Which one are yours? Well, really, it's all mine. Hey, sweetie. How's it going? Everything is fine, Dad. I'm just here watching TV while the rest of my friends party their life away -at the bonfire. -Uh-huh. Uh, tell Christopher it's almost 9 o'clock. He heard you. He said he's about to leave in a minute. -Hi, Dad. -Hello, Christopher. Remember, I can see you. I know. Dad, you do not have cameras in my room. Are you finally getting on your flight? Yeah, I'm already onboard. Weather's long gone and it looks like I'll be home in about five or six hours. Well, have a safe flight. - Does the plane have Wi-Fi? - Yeah, you know it does. I'll be checking on you every hour - and make sure you're okay. - You're the one that's scared. I should be calling to check on you. -True. -Or I can just stay with her - if you need me to. - Unless you need a broken neck, I suggest you leave at 9:00. I actually don't need a broken neck. I love you, Dad. I love you too, baby. Bye-bye. All right. Well, I gotta be home. It's almost 9:00 and I'm definitely scared of your father. So... are you sure you're gonna be okay all alone? Boy, I'm always by myself. -True. -Plus, if anything happens, I could just run outside and Little Anky here will alert the police. It's like my own little alarm system. That's crazy.

Do you have... - does anyone have a phone? - Sir? I need... I need a phone. Can I... do you have -a phone I could borrow? -No, I'm sorry. Excuse me, sir. I need you to take a seat. Listen to me, listen to me. - My daughter is home alone. - Okay. And I just saw an intruder - breaking into my house... - Oh, no. - on the phone. My phone just died. -I need a phone right... -Sir, I understand - your concern but you must... - No, no, no, no, no. - sit down. -No. It's not of my concern. You do not get it. I just told you that my daughter's life could be in danger and you're telling me to calm down. No. I need to get to a phone right now. Sir, you're interrupting our passengers. - You understand me? - I understand your concern. - Do you understand me? - Just follow me, please. It's not my right now. - Please. - Now. Where did I put the phone? Stupid phone. Where did I put it? My God, where is my phone up? Oh. Lexi, baby, it's daddy. Um, listen, I just saw someone on the camera breaking into the side of the house. Okay? I'm calling the cops right now. What's up, babe? Houston, we have a problem. My dad saw you on the camera coming through the side door. And he thinks somebody broke into the house. You're the one who told me to come over. Surprise. Oh, my God. Thank you so much. Tess was right. We never have anything to eat up in this house. So, you mean you're telling me this is a snacky call, -not a booty call? -Well, when I get this thing off my ankle, then maybe it'll be a booty call. But until then, you're just a late night food cart guy. See? I told you that I would be able to sneak out the house without my pops noticing. You want me to stay? No, it's okay. I'm fine. Plus, you gotta sneak back in without him noticing. Right. But here's a little something, something He's probably the only one with access to all the cameras. The only thing I can think of is he had a camera installed without me knowing. Damn. He got you on a serious lockdown. What we did he shall see? It's not what I did. It's what happened to my mother. Oh, shit. That makes sense. Damn, so he saw me? Yeah. What are we gonna do? I have to try to figure out a way to explain it to him. I tried to call him, but his phone is going to voicemail. He's still on the plane, so the Wi-Fi is probably tripping. All right. Well, let me know how that goes. Okay. Get some sleep. Oh. How long does it take for the Wi-Fi to connect? It does take a few moments, sir. Don't you guys have an airplane phone I could use? It's against airline policies to allow our passengers to use our phone. For all we know, you could have fabricated your story. The best thing I can do is allow you to use your own phone. This is ridiculous. My daughter could be dead by now. I'm so sorry. Stop! Tap, tap, tap, tap. Are you trying to get yourself hurt, dad? Uh, no. I was just trying to test you and, uh, congratulations, you passed. I'm not sure my back did. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm good. I'm good down here. You're getting old, Dad. Maybe so. But, um, but, you know, I... I'm proud of you. Always be ready for any situation. Crime doesn't come with a warning. -That's right. -I know. Yeah. I miss her, too. Every day I wake up, I'm hoping it was a dream or a nightmare. You still have me. And, you know... I'm good with that. And I promise to always keep you safe. Oh, thank God. Is everything okay, sir? False alarm. It turned out it was her boyfriend. She's safe, but not for me when I get home. You seem like a really good dad. Not a lot of young women have that nowadays. Lord knows I didn't have that growing up. Well, she's my everything. Her mother must be happy to have you. Uh-hmm. Her mother passed last year. Home invasion. What are the odds of my wife being murdered by a serial killer, huh? I'm so sorry to hear that. Yeah. It's okay. I'm just getting strong enough to talk about it. Good for you. Keith Mitchell. Beverly Jones. It is a pleasure to meet you. Mine, too. And thank you for everything, and I'm sorry about all the raucous. Um, I guess you could, uh, understand why now, huh? Absolutely.

Are you so bored with your little video games that you got to keep calling me? No. I just wanna talk to you. Well, I'm on the phone and I don't wanna talk to you. Then why did you answer, hmm? Because I wanted to tell you to stop calling my phone. Well, that's all you had to say? I'll go now. But first... answer my question. What is the question? Are you scared? Scared of what? Being home alone? How did you know I was home alone? I didn't, but now I do... Alexis. Arming safe. Garage door. Garage door. Get out of here. Stupid cat. You're good. Just a cat. Sara, thank you for coming in. Now, is there any description you can give us about this guy? He was tall. He was in a mask, so I never got a look at his face. I am sorry, I wish there was anything that I can do. No, it's-it's-it's okay. You're doing great, Ms. Gutierrez. Is there any way you can tell us how you managed to get free? Well, he was... You don't have to do this if you don't want to. It's okay. He was choking me until I pass out, so I guess he thought that I was already dead. I came to when he had his back turned. I didn't waste any time. I jumped up and run straight toward the front door. I kept running and I never stopped. Honestly, I thought that he was right behind me. But he wasn't. I haven't been able to sleep since. I see him in my dreams, I see him in my room. The image of that mask haunt me every day. Sara, I know this is a lot for you, but I have to ask you this again, is there anything you can remember about this guy? Maybe something he left behind? A weakness, I mean, anything to help us find this monster? None. He was smart. He wore gloves. Never talk. It was like he was hunting me and he wouldn't even stop until I was dead. The fact that I passed out was the only reason that I'm still alive. Hello. Is there anything I can get you? Is there anything I could for you? No. Thanks. Beverly, thank you. Phone's all charged now. I appreciate it. Anything for my disgruntled passenger. Again, I'm sorry for the disturbance. Don't be. You had every reason to be. It shows you're protective, caring, and passionate. We really do need more men like you. Thank you for saying that. Listen, I'll actually be in LA for few days real soon and maybe me and you can go for a drink or coffee. I mean, nothing too serious, of course. Just two people having a drink. Wow. I'm very flattered. I mean, you must have guys falling all over themselves trying to get to you, right? Guys, yes. Men? Uh-uh. You are clearly a sweet person. Not to mention, drop dead gorgeous. Why do I feel like there's a "but" coming up? But... I'm just not ready... yet. I understand. How about this, when you are ready... feel free to give a sister a call. Yes, ma'am. Is there anything I can get for you? All right. You are in trouble. Oh, my God. -Beverly, listen. -Keith, calm down. -What's wrong? -I didn't notice it... I don't know how I missed it. I thought my daughter was okay but she's not. Look. Keith, it's just a cute selfie of your daughter. No, over her left shoulder. We have to call the authorities. Okay. Now, calling 911 from the airplane phone is a little bit different. We have to be exact so they know what department to transfer us to. What state do you live in? -Inglewood. -Inglewood. Good evening, this is Beverly Jones from Gray Airways, badge number 4567. I'm on Flight 104. I have a passenger that has an emergency. He thinks his daughter is at home and she's in terrible danger. What's your address? -5237. -5237... -Maple Street. -...Maple Street. -ZIP code? -90309. 90309. Tell them to hurry. They're transferring me. I'm so sorry, Keith. Dad, please, please, please, dad, pick up. Alexis, baby? Dad. Thank God you're okay. Where are you in the house now? I'm in the closet. Okay. I need you to stay right there. I saw the person behind you in the picture that you sent to me. I know, I know. I was looking for your gun. Where did you put it? - I got rid of it. - Why? That's not important right now. And-and keep your voice down, baby. Dad, please, please, tell me what to do. I don't know. I'm getting scared. Okay, baby, just-just breathe, try to relax, everything's going to be okay. I already called the police. They're on their way. I want you to stay there until they get there. But baby, if he come for you, what are you gonna do? I'mma tear out his soul. That's my baby girl. Miller to base, looks pretty quiet. I'm not sure if anyone's home. Hello, is anyone home? Officer Miller, Inglewood PD. Please, please, help me. I'm upstairs, I'm in my room. He's in the house, please. Ma'am, I'm here to help. Tell me where in the house you're located and I'm here to assist you. Look out, he's behind you! No! Dad, please, please, he killed the officer. I'm scared. I don't wanna die. -What do I do? -Your ankle monitor. I need you to use your ankle monitor to alert the police. Try to sneak out and get as far away as you can. Baby? Hello? Dammit! Not now! Please tell me you have some backup Wi-Fi on this plane? I mean, what... it's got to be connected to the air traffic controller or whatever the hell sends a signal out here. Yes, but it has nothing to do with home Wi-Fi, Keith. But isn't there anything you could do? Unfortunately, Keith, we just have to wait for it -to turn back on. -Okay, goddammit! If something happens to my baby girl, I'm gonna sue this damn airline! Keith, I need you to calm down! And remember, I am on your side! You heard what she said, right? That-that guy killed the police officer we sent out. What are we supposed to do? What?! Everybody, please stay calm. Everything is going to be okay. I need you guys to remain seated. Please, remain seated, keep your seatbelts on. Everything is going to be okay. I got a strange call directed to Inglewood PD from an airplane. Sent an officer by to take a look and he said it was all clear. And you're telling me this why? The address belongs to Keith Mitchell. His daughter Alexis' own house arrest. Mitchell... Detective, I have an Alexis Mitchell for you. Please, ma'am. Have a seat. Where's your father? He's on a business trip. He told me to come. I'll share everything with him later. I called you in because I wanted to discuss something with the both of you. But since your father's not here, I guess I'll share it with you. We may have some information on your mother's killer that may be able to give you some closure. Really? Mitchell. -Are you sure it's Mitchell... -Absolutely. Shit. Okay, baby, where are you in the house now? Upstairs. I can hear him downstairs. Okay. I-I can see him. I can see him. He's on the side of the house. Go to the garage now. Okay. Hello? No. How long until we land? Twenty-minutes tops. Garage door. Come on, asshole! Garage door. Alexis? Alexis, please, lower your gun. It's empty. Easy. What the hell happened here? I didn't know what else to do. He was gonna kill me. Are you okay? Baby! Are you okay? Did he hurt you? Dad I got him. Yeah. Police told me that you... you shot him. Dad, I don't think you're hearing me. I got "him." "Him?" Where's your father? He's on a business trip. He told me to come. I'll share everything with him later. I called you in because I wanted to discuss something with the both of you. But since your father is not here, I guess I'll share with you. We may have some information on your mother's killer that may be able to give you some closure. Really? Justin Humphries. He's been in and out of jail for petty crimes. We found his DNA underneath your mother's fingernails when she scratched his face. That's how we found him. Do you know where he is now? We're working on that now as we speak, Mrs. Mitchell. Call me Alexis. My mother was Mrs. Mitchell. Alexis. We do know that your mother wasn't supposed to be the target. She was housesitting. For her friend Heather, yes. Heather's daughter Joanne was a part of this chat room where teenagers meet up. That's where she met Justin. How do you know this? I spoke to Heather and Joanne, and Joanne was supposed to be home alone that night. But she convinced her mother to allow her to go to a party. So Heather called your mother to house it. Your mother wasn't supposed to be there. Joanne was. I want you to find this guy and I want you to lock him up forever. Nobody else should have to lose a parent or a child because of this monster. I promise you, Alexis. I'm gonna do everything in my power to find this guy. Excuse me. I gotta take this. Vincent? Hey. What do you have? all right. All right. Great work. I'll see you back at the station. We have some great news. We may have a lead on Justin. I'll call you if I have any other updates. Thank you, Mr. Nelson. Please, don't call me Mr. Nelson. That was my father's name. Call me Greg. Yes. Just leave it at the door. Thank you. You better go get that door. Thanks. Take the mask off. Now! It's nothing personal. It was for her. Her who? My mother. Him. Justin Humphries. He killed your wife. I'm so sorry we couldn't do more to catch the son of a bitch. We didn't make the connection until it was too late. Ms. Mitchell, are you sure this was self-defense? What are you trying to say? A serial killer breaks into my house and tries to kill me, then I used a gun of the cop he murdered on camera to defend myself? Does that sound premeditated to you? Do you know how ridiculous you sound right now? Listen, my daughter was nearly killed by the same monster who murdered my wife. I think it's safe to say the guy got what we deserved. I'm happy to know that you're safe, Alexis. Mr. Mitchell's right. Let's go.
