Even women can easily install it. Thank you for your detailed explanation. (7 years later) breakfast is ready. Voice assistant, adjust the volume to 3. Shouldn't we order this anymore? If you shake it carefully, it won't clump, and it contains 72 ingredients It can supplement the nutrients that are often lacking in daily life. But it has less protein. because you value your muscles. right. Taste is okay, and there's a variety of flavors. It's a pity. Rihe, what are you going to do today? I'm going to the dry cleaner's, clean the window screens, and then help remove mold from the bathroom. Let's have Indian minced meat curry for lunch. Aren't we having brunch now? We're having breakfast now, lunch is lunch. We should think positively. Oh, I see. Alright. Come over here. Don't rush, but be quick. Go ahead. Thank you. Thank you. We still have 15 minutes until opening. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry for making you rush. It's definitely not a problem. Miyata, you're so absolute in your words. I'm truly sorry. Go ahead. Mr. Tamura, the goods have been delivered. Please sign here. - Thank you for your hard work. - thank you. Four extra hard polishing heads. Three hexagonal rotary polishing heads. Three hexagonal diamond polishing heads. Ota, it seems like Shion, the part-timer, has a crush on you. Even though you're married, you're still so popular. It's unfair. What are you saying? You're getting married soon too. And don't call me "Tamu" anymore. During working hours, you should address me as Mr. Tamura or Assistant Manager. Okay. Two hexagonal handle sharpening stones with handles. Hexagonal handle sharpening stone with a handle. Hexagonal handle sharpening stone. What's wrong? I think I have premarital jitters. - Premarital jitters? - Yes. Although Shizuka can be terrifying when she gets angry, she's actually a nice person. Otherwise, she wouldn't make such good bento lunches for you. But I feel a lot of pressure. (Tonight is possible.) Just the thought of getting married and becoming a family... Suddenly, I don't feel like making love anymore. Her body just seems like a lump of flesh now. It's been two and a half years since my wife and I last did it. Two and a half years? Really? The lack of sex causes irritation and a sense of loss. Basically, it's due to a deficiency of neurotransmitter serotonin. So, if you increase serotonin, you don't need to have sex. To increase serotonin, you need to... Sunbathe, exercise moderately, and consume carbohydrates. Marriage overlooks the root of the problem and uses laughter to gloss over it. I'm not glossing over anything. By the way, take a look at this. Just type "husband" and then a space. Look. "Husband dies." Why is it "dies" instead of "go die"? It means the wife wishes for her husband to die from illness or accident. That's so scary. It's been five years in my house. Five years without sex. In other words, you were still doing it until five years ago? - no... - I'm sorry. Have you two heard of this? "Husband Death Notebook"? It's a website where you can vent your accumulated dissatisfaction with your husband. Miss Minoyama, have you also submitted something there? Well... it's like this. "My husband's nails are dirty and filthy." "I want to cut off his fingers" ("Mt. Minoyama") - "You're using your real name?" - "I won't submit secretly and sneakily." - "So impressive." - "So powerful." This person's submissions are particularly interesting. "Before dawn on a certain holiday." It hurts so much. To avoid being attacked by my husband, who has different sleeping habits." Even if I use his hand as a pillow to suppress him." "I couldn't sleep because of his murderous snoring." "Early in the morning, I started cleaning the house." "And then, finally, my husband wakes up." "You woke me up." Is breakfast not ready yet? "I'm not your cooking machine" Exactly, there really are people like this. "Why do I have to bear all the household chores alone?" "Even though I also have a job." "And the most outrageous part is..." Let's have Indian minced meat curry for lunch. He said it. Now it's brunch, isn't it? "Even if I express my opinion." It's breakfast now, and lunch is lunch. Let's think positively. "That's right, humans always get hungry." "Okay." "For the Indian minced meat curry you ordered, I'll use..." "Nutritious frozen rat meat to prepare it for you." It's so funny, right? "Charlie" "Charlie" [The Dog won’t Eat it, but Charlie Laughs] Oh no. (Call Happon Co., Ltd.) Thank you for your hard work. (Pay with "Chacha" using the mobile phone.)

Skills are more important than appearance. You need to evaluate yourself properly. I'm really sorry. I wasn't referring to you, Miss Tamura. I wasn't talking about you just now. I was just upset because of the previous phone call. It hit me psychologically. Is it the fault of the system, Dad? Always complaining about the system, in the end... Say in Kansai dialect, "I'll show you how it's done, idiot." Maybe I'm being too serious. You should relax your shoulders a bit. Don't take people living in a dystopia too seriously. Think positively. I don't like the phrase "think positively." it's just making excuses. Did you have a fight with your husband? Next time you complain about your husband to me, Of course, you should think positively. (Publisher, Yamaguchi Tsuyoshi, Valley Publishing) Please make sure we publish it. Your submission for "Death Notebook"... Are you suggesting publishing it as a book? We plan to compile the submissions from seven people into a book. But "Charlie's" submission will be the most highly recommended. I'm sorry. Suddenly talking about publishing a book must have been troubling for you, right? But your submission is very popular and highly praised. Many people can relate to it, right? yes. Please don't worry. The book will be published under "Charlie's" name. Your husband won't know it's you. Mrs. Tamura. Do you want to use your unique article to teach all the useless husbands in Japan a lesson? Please let me consider it. "Can we not talk while eating?" "I hate kissing you, so please don't spray saliva everywhere." The most annoying clichés from my husband." "It's really tough being in a managerial position." It's so easy for lower-level employees to just follow the rules." They're just sneering at my position in a roundabout way." "All talk, my husband is just an 'assistant' store manager." "Just the assistant to the store manager, backup, substitute." "I found a dirty sock in the couch crevice." "How does it feel to be suffocated by your own stench?" I'm back. Welcome back. Did you feed Charlie? Sorry, not yet. No need to get up, I'll do it. Charlie wait for me. "The higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment, so I no longer expect." "Shall I help you wash your body?" "The higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment." "Too many muscles in the brain..." "I don't get it..." "No motivation." "Worthless." What's wrong? Nothing. "Disappointed." "Exhausted" "Let me prepare a dish for you using frozen rat meat." "You got home earlier, so why didn't you feed the pet?" "Just starve to death on your own, okay?" "I understand." "so funny" "totally agree" "A husband who leaves everything to his wife deserves the death penalty." "I think you're right, Charlie." Today is Sunday, so you're leaving late? No, I'm on the morning shift today. Then I'll prepare dinner first. Can we call it a day? Don't you like it? Fine, forget it. Will Tamura attend Wakatsuki's wedding? Yes, I will. I heard you're responsible for the speech. Yes, that's correct. Why didn't he come to me, the store manager, for the speech? Maybe because I introduced them to each other? He might have thought it was more polite that way. I'm going to be honest here. Because it's considered unlucky. You've been divorced three times as a store manager. I'm sorry, excuse me. - Good morning, Assistant Manager. - Don't call me Assistant Manager - That's how you wanted me to address you. - Stop arguing. What's going on? Good morning. Was it Yukino who wrote yesterday's Death Note? Is that true? Have you talked to her about it? Can she still come to my wedding? Didn't you quit smoking? Does Yukino know? I didn't tell her. What happened? Right? Nothing happened. Our marriage is perfect. Here are the products. Any recommended products? Recommended products? Please wait a moment. Hello. This product allows for neat storage. It doesn't take up space when not in use. When you pull down your clothes, the roller rotates. You can easily take off all your clothes at once. All at once? It's called the "One Breath Clothes Rack." I'll take it. - Thank you. - Thank you for your purchase. Mr. Tamura, you're so handsome. - Where am I handsome? - Please explain vividly. - Embrace each other at once. - In one breath. Take it off together. Take it off together. I want to use your explanation. Embrace each other at once. he looks so silly. He's laughing foolishly while looking at the messaging app. And then? Then I sneak a peek at his phone. Although the name is male, the conversation is clearly female. So he feels guilty and deliberately changes it to a male name, right? He's really useless. Yuhiko, you should be careful too. In the end, spouses are outsiders and can easily betray each other. Like me, busy taking care of children and having no time for myself. It really annoys me. Darling, sorry, Mom was just joking earlier. Akira, I might publish a book. A book? A submission for "Death Note." Really? That's amazing. The publisher said they would focus on me. But I haven't decided yet. "Patience leads to a clear view of the moon." what are you talking about? You forgot what you wrote yourself? The graduation thesis in high school. Did I write something like this? For things you can never wait for, just do them. We can go through the tunnel now. Thank you for always sending things. You're welcome. It's nothing. You like pears, right? Thank you. Are you busy with work recently? Yes, I'm quite busy. I see. But you're not young anymore. Leave the money-making to Yujiro. It's about time... Mom, sorry, I have to catch the train. Really? Then I'll hang up. Sorry, my apologies. Voice assistant, stop playback. Hello? Mrs. Tamura, sorry for calling you suddenly. This is Tsukagoshi. The authors of "Death Note" are gathering tonight. now? Yes. It's a bit inconvenient... Wait for me a moment. "I will be home late today. No need to prepare dinner." I can attend the gathering. "Borrowing my husband's toothbrush for cleaning the drain." "Three Eggplants" "Cherry blossoms falling, you should also wither away." "Inverted Whale" "North Korea, shoot missiles at my husband." "Spreading deadly poison." "I will beat you to a pulp at any cost." "Tower of the Sun." "Hair tonic, let me replace it with hair loss tonic." "giant spoon" "Only my husband, struck by lightning, think of it positively." "Charlie" (Ruirin Chinese Restaurant) Whenever my husband sees a tiny grain of rice falling, he would say, "It's so dirty, you should clean properly." Speaking with an arrogant tone. He doesn't even wash his hands after going to the bathroom and dares to criticize others. We understand. He never helps out normally, only pretends to do chores when his parents are around. It's so annoying to watch. When I clean diapers and vomit, he never comes close even with a disgusted expression. He just plays with the kids for a bit and thinks he's a good father. Stop pretending, okay? I think Japanese men are only gentle at the beginning turn into scumbags in bed, become useless after marriage, and disappear after having children. we understand. He keeps wanting it, so I have to have sex with him. He even said he wanted to see me climax, but I've only relied on acting. You've never made me climax. Why don't you hurry up and die? we understand. What do you think? Everyone is very convincing, right? Mr. Tsukagoshi, are you married? I'm single. I don't want to get married, so I wear a wedding ring and pretend I'm married. Marriage involves both families and various complications like moving and changing residency. All these troublesome matters only make it harder to break up. Watching you all, I'm even more convinced of my own beliefs. You're very honest. I'm tired of being polite. You can't make everyone like you. Sorry I'm late. Let me introduce Mrs. Minoyama, who submitted using her real name. Nice to meet you. Now we have everyone here today. "All things about husbands are dirty and should be deodorized." "Minoyama." - Can I go to your place tonight? - Why? why not? Well, I guess... Can I? - You said it's okay. - Yes, it's okay... Wait a moment. He keeps staring at us. - Shall we go? - Let's go. It's the first time I've seen someone bowing to Seidai like that. "Kanshin Shounen" is useful, isn't it? It's easy to assemble. Thank you. Are you eating curry? Do you know where curry originated in Japan? India? India is indeed the birthplace of curry. But it was actually brought by the British during the Meiji era. It's written in this book called "Western Cuisine Guide." It seems that frogs were used as ingredients back then. And the Maritime Self-Defense Force always has curry on Fridays. Because it's easy to forget what day it is when you live at sea. Since I don't have anything specific to do, my brain is filled with useless knowledge. You're not interested in it, right? I'm very interested. Only you would say something like that to me. Excuse me… Yujiro. My name is Yujiro Tamura. I'm Hiyori Sugimoto. Are you looking for a job? Yes, I am. But it's difficult to switch jobs. During middle school, we had a music competition between classes. I couldn't play any musical instruments, so I thought I could at least play the cymbals. Even though I was responsible for playing the cymbals, I was the only one. That song required seven cymbal strikes in total, and I practiced for a long time. During the competition, I kept reminding myself when to strike, but my hand froze. Finally, I managed to strike, but because I was too nervous, I... I struck 37 times. -37 times? -Yes. Do you know any methods to relieve nervousness? What method? Try licking your own elbow. Elbow? They say it's physically impossible for humans to lick their own elbows. I said try, I didn't say you'll succeed. Even though you say that... Licking your elbow feels silly and helps you forget about being nervous. you're right. 37 times. That's too much. But now you can laugh about it. It means that experience wasn't in vain. Your seemingly useless knowledge is actually quite useful. Actually, Seidai's original name means "perfection." So, this means "perfection." Assistant manager, are you alone? Yes, Shiori, are you alone too? I often eat here and read manga at the same time. Can I join you? Sure. Mr. Tamura, How long have you been married? Almost four years. Four years, huh? The fourth year of marriage is called the "flower wedding." It symbolizes the blossoming of love and the preparation for the future. Expecting that the couple will soon have children. Impressive. You know a lot of details. That's because I really want to get married. It's so wonderful to marry the person you love. Shiori, you're still young. I don't think marriage is the ultimate happiness for modern women. But if I can't get married, I would still long for it. What do you mean by not being able to get married? Because the other person is already married? Tamura Yujiro is terrible. Absolutely awful. I can't believe Charlie is you. Huh? This is… I couldn't protect this child. I've always felt that it was my fault. The thing about my pregnancy... I didn't tell any family or friends. So I couldn't talk to anyone about it. But at that time... That person couldn't be there for me. Did you tell Tamura that you needed him to be with you? i didn't mean to hurt him. I just wanted to vent my emotions with the Death Note. Is it really okay just like that? Tamura might already know about the Death Note. Sorry, I didn't know that Charlie was you. Show him Charlie's submission. (Shione) "I'm glad to have dinner with Mr. Tamura." "The joyful time went by so quickly. I ate a lot." "I hope I have another chance to chat with Mr. Tamura." (The era without plastic bags has come. Kita-tarou) (Ambassador of reusable bags) Oh, by the way... I've already bought the congratulatory red envelopes. Thank you. On the day of the wedding, the boss insisted that I work, but I declined. You have to work even during weddings and funerals. Is that true? I'll work seriously. Just don't do that kind of job. Do you know that cling film wasn't originally used for wrapping food? What do you mean? It was originally used to line military boots. I'm not asking about that. Are you saying that anyone could do my job? That anyone could replace me? Are you looking down on me? i didn't say that. I just… Forget it. (Tomorrow? Of course, I'd love to go. I'm looking forward to it.) "Kitaro"? Hey, Mrs. Minoyama. I wanted to ask you something... what do you want? nothing. - Long time no see. - Thank you. Can you not answer the phone? Sure, no problem. Okay. Alright. -Cheers. -Cheers. So stingy. He doesn't answer his wife's calls at all. Then take the opportunity to have a big fight with him? If you can argue, maybe the relationship will be healthier. If things continue like this, you'll continue to endure a solitary life for over ten years just to maintain the institution of marriage. Will you be happy in such a situation? Isn't it supposed to be easier once you're inside the system? But how did it turn out like this? Originally, I wanted to go straight ahead, but I veered off course at some point. That's because humans... are driven by emotions, not just thoughts. Here we go again. You're like this with everyone, right? That's not true. It's only with you. Driven by emotions? There are people like that everywhere in the company. Just try them out. Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon was with his left foot. Come on. Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon was with his left foot. Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon was with... his left foot. People in Antarctica never catch cold, no matter how cold it is. Because it's so cold that even viruses can't survive. Really? Corn kernels must be an even number. Someone actually counted them. Ishikawa Takuboku was expelled from high school for cheating. Fortunately, Takuboku later became a poet. Luigi's real name is "Luigi Mario." And Mario's real name is "Mario Mario." "Mario Mario"? The longest stroke in hiragana is "ぬ" (nu). It's not "ね" (ne) after all. Two characters are just a little different. If you can catch it before it falls to the ground, you'll be very happy Missed it. They're kissing. kissing. they keep staring at us. A great position, they call it overtime, but it's actually cheating." Like a cliché extramarital affair soap opera. It makes me sick." Divorce is finally getting closer step by step." What does it mean? This "Charlie," that's you, right? You can write such harsh things and still maintain a smile. Because I can smile by writing them. Comments like this on the internet are one-sided. They harm the other person unilaterally, who can't refute. You just want to get likes from everyone and be happy, don't you? Yes, I'm happy when someone likes it. I write such harsh things, yet I can gain everyone's approval. But you shouldn't avoid direct communication with me. And at our marriage, you said household chores would be your responsibility. I just need to focus on work, right? That's you. I changed my mind a long time ago. When I had a miscarriage. You have no idea what emotions I held. You pretend it never happened with your physical training and work. I didn't pretend it never happened. But you simply don't care about me. That's not true. I do care about you. I just give you space. It's all the same. Then what should I do? Do you want me to say I understand your feelings? That would only make you angrier, right? I just… I want you to mourn with me. And you're the one who avoids direct communication. - That wedding for Wakatsuki. - I know. It's against etiquette for the husband to give a speech if the wife isn't present. That's not how it goes, right? - Mr. tamura. - Yes. Thank you for your help. - You've worked hard - Thank you. Do you have contact with Hiyori? I know you leave a message for "Charlie". Please don't interfere in our marriage anymore. Do you have the right to blame me? Haven't you made a decision yet? When you said you were considering whether to publish a book, You wanted my encouragement, right? You're easily influenced by others' opinions. Anyway, you'll end up accepting it, so hurry up and do it. It was me who recommended "Death Note" to you in the first place. It's all spilled out. It's okay. Don't make it sound like I always listen to you. Is having a child so amazing? Is it pitiful not to be able to have a child after marriage? Am I just inferior? Am I defective? You probably think that a family with children is perfect. There's no such thing as perfection in this world. what's wrong with you? You scared me. Please let me officially decline the invitation to publish a book. Huh? You'll receive a manuscript fee and royalties. The paperback sells for 1,500 yen, and the royalty is 10%. You can get 70%. If you sell 100,000 copies, you will earn 10.5 million. It's not just your husband. Let's together destroy all husbands in the world. My submission is not targeting all husbands in the world. I just want to express my feelings towards my own husband (Death Note for Husbands) (Every day I hope my husband dies immediately) Mrs. San Qiezi Husband, where should we go to celebrate our wedding anniversary? I want to go abroad this year. (Death Note for Husbands, writing down death note) Why are you feeling down? It's because his wife will really kill him in reality. Tomorrow is a joyful wedding. Drinking, singing, it's so lively. Blessings, blessings, sincere blessings. But... Tomorrow, the two of them will enter the grave of love. And then it's a continuous decline, sinking deeper. Marriage is the end of life. Wakatsuki joined the company and worked with us, six years ago. He's cheerful and friendly. get off. - come. - what's the matter? -Come quickly. -What's happening? What's going on? The bride and groom haven't arrived yet. -Really? -Can't understand what they're doing. Can't believe it. She is the bride, Miss Shizuka. Thank you. Get off quickly. Why do I have to deliver you? I'm on vacation today. What else do you want at this point? Bastard. Wakatsuki became hopeless about marriage after reading the Death Note. Walk faster. You need to sign properly. It's not like signing a delivery receipt. You, Mr. Hiroto Wakatsuki, will marry Miss Shizuka as your wife. In sickness and in health, In richness and in poverty, Will you love her and comfort her? Will you vow to sincerely treat her for the rest of your life? Will you vow? He said, "I vow." I want to throw up. Rihe. Next, the groom's superior from work, Mr. Tamura Yujiro, will give a congratulatory speech. - Tamura. - It's up to you. please come on stage. Mr. Tamura. Tamura! What is he doing? Thank you for the introduction. I work together with Wakatsuki at the home furnishings store... Yujiro Tamura. Congratulations to both of you, Wakatsuki and Shizuka, on your marriage. Congratulations. The current home furnishings store is different from before. We have three times more products.

Green sofa. All of these were chosen by me and my wife together. Even insignificant things don't matter. Necessary daily necessities. Please make sure both husband and wife carefully choose them. In the long journey of marriage, we may forget to consider each other, Sometimes we may look down on each other, Sometimes it's hard and I want to escape. In times like this, please remember the moments when we started living together Starting from nothing, we built a new life together. Our hearts were filled with anticipation. I think that's the meaning of marriage. so… Miss Shizuka, I'm counting on you, Wakatsuki. Wakatsuki, congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. Don't be like this, it's embarrassing. crybaby. well said. Wakatsuki… You're Mr. Tamura's... wife, right? Yes. Go ahead. I'm Shione Shizumi. Um... Mrs. Minoyama told me that I caused problems between you and your husband. Because Mr. Tamura and Mamiya had a close relationship, I was worried that Mamiya would be taken away. So, I deliberately got close to Mr. Tamura, hoping that he would get into trouble and be forced to leave the company. But please believe me, no matter how much I flirted with him, he remained indifferent. Thank you for telling me. We envy couples like you, who are legally recognized. Please continue to be happy and fulfilled. That's enough. Kota. Someone, please save me. Attending a wedding ceremony? Congratulations, indeed. The green sofa. Air purifier that doesn't require filter replacement. Ceramic frying pan. Cat-shaped massage roller for acupressure points. Dumpling-patterned cushion. Mugs. Matching mugs. Charlie. Charlie. We're back. Jason from the horror movie "Friday the 13th." His weapon is a chainsaw, but he never uses it. That's right. Edvard Munch's famous painting "The Scream" is actually not screaming, but covering his ears because he can't stand the scream. Really? Birds of prey like Charlie, once they find a partner, they never separate. Mrs. Tamura. Mrs. Tamura. Mr. Tsukakoshi from the publishing company. Mrs. Tamura, can you reconsider? I have already declined. The company and other contributors are ready to publish. The print media is struggling, and just getting a proposal approved is tough. Do you know how hard it is? I'm sorry for giving you hope. I'm truly sorry. Apologies won't solve this. What's wrong with you? We were going to help an amateur like you publish a book. You really think highly of yourself. Stop it. It's because you're a useless husband that this happened. Couples like you, who are only superficially together, will soon break up. Marriages will crumble. What are you doing? Let go of me! Are you okay? That level of injury is nothing. -Thank you. -Please eat. When his father was still alive, he became obsessed with fishing with him. I used to wake up before dawn to make his lunch. So, how should I say it... Fish bait? He collected all sorts of strange-looking bait. sounds fun. so… What do you think? Did you choose to live here because you're considering having a baby? Mom, wait a minute. Yujiro, are you okay? Little Yu. Stop saying that. How can you just stop? Don't get discouraged. It's just one failure. how do you know? did you tell her? I just told her the truth. Miscarriage is not that uncommon. You're still young. It's not that simple. Regardless of whether it's once or twice, it's not about the number. The number you dialed cannot be connected. (Home Goods Store - Shima Chuo) We need to be able to propose a comfortable home life. Our goal is to become experts in this. The necessary conditions to achieve this goal are... Love for customers. Kotera. Good morning. -What’s wrong with you? - don't touch. - Just a little bump. - Just a little bump? Let's all work hard together today. Good morning. Stop staring at me. (Mr. Yujiro Tamura, please pick up.) (Hiyori.) (Divorce application.) Voice Assistant, do you know where Hiyori is? I don't know. I'm sorry. This is coarse wax used for sanding before painting a car. There are two types: one for white cars and one for metal cars. Don't mix them up. - Which one is this? - It's for metal cars. Correct. Also... The gardening department. This one. For the garden... That's Kita-taro. Do you have any weed killer? - Yes, this way, please. - Thank you. There are many types. This one is banned overseas. Please remove it from your inventory. Remove it? We have to remove it. And as for this... It's gentle to the Earth and living beings. The most important thing is understanding, consideration, and care... - You scared me. - You scared me. - What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with you? What do you think a couple is? Why are you suddenly asking that? I'm getting more and more confused. "Not understanding" might be the right answer. Just like catching eels. Eels? You think you've caught one, but it slips away. You think you understand each other, but then you don't. But if you give up trying to catch it, you will only become more and more incomprehensible My husband Had a stroke five years ago and is still in the hospital. On the "Death Note" website, people usually submit anonymously without their spouses knowing. But I showed my submissions to my husband willingly. He said, "You really dare to write," and he laughed happily. Being together is taken for granted, so is feeling dissatisfied. But none of this should be taken for granted. (half price) - Excuse me. - Yes? I'm looking for a seismic tool suitable for this. This way, please. Thank you. This is the "Super Seismic Warrior." It has the widest contact surface. It's made of high-density ethyl carbamate material. It won't damage the ceiling or furniture. What's even better than the previous "Seismic Warrior" is that it can withstand a compressive load of up to 1.5 tons. 1.5 tons... As for the "Super Seismic Warrior," it can withstand up to 2 tons. I also need to make more changes. What's going on? We can't avoid it. We must face each other properly. (Home Furnishings Store, Shimachu) (Call Partner Co., Ltd.) Miss Tamura, Someone called just now asking for you to answer the phone. who is it? I asked who they were, but they didn't answer. - I also received that call. - Me too. I told him I couldn't transfer the call to you. Thank you for calling. This is the Chacha Customer Service Center, and my last name is Tamura. Hello? It's me. What? Can you say it again? it's me. why are you calling? What do you expect to achieve by running away from home like this? Don't shout. Don't bother me at work by calling the company. I can't accept it. I don't care whether you accept it or not. Miss Tamura, Are you okay? I'm fine. Thank you for calling. I'm Tamura... Wait a moment. - I'm Tamura... - Hold on. I'm Tamura, and that's as far as my service goes. I didn't ask you to wait. What's your business here? Why did you come to my workplace? what do you want? Stuck in the crack of the sofa. What's that? Your sock. It's not toe socks, just regular socks. So what? Are you saying it's my fault too? Not exactly. Yes and no, but that's not what I meant. When I found that sock, I laughed. I laughed because I realized you're just like me. Look at it from a positive perspective. What do you mean by that? What does "look at it from a positive perspective" mean? I really hate that phrase. It's just an excuse you make for yourself. It's not really looking at things positively. I'm not talking about that right now. - Cut it out. - who are you? - I'm her boss, got it? - What's going on? I'm sorry, truly sorry. Where are you going? Calm down. - Let me go. - It's dangerous. Stop it. look. Katsuragi I'm talking about you. Me? I'm talking to my husband right now. What's this outsider who can't even write "husband" doing here? It's pathetic to think that all women will fall for you. That's right. After getting in bed, you completely change. Calling yourself handsome is just a façade. What are you all doing? Do you know where you are? Don't forget, this is a company. Don't think you're so important and act all high and mighty. We all know you use your authority to harass subordinates. Don't look down on others just to preserve your pride. This kind of job will be replaced by artificial intelligence in the future. Don't use so many computers and worsen global warming. please help me pay the rent. Working in customer service isn't popular on dating sites. I never want to ride a packed train again. All of you, You are all fired. What's this joke? Is it another system problem? Use your own brain for once. You always blame the system for all the problems. I'm going to teach you a lesson, you idiot. As you said, it's all the system's fault. Why should I pay alimony? It was you who initiated the divorce. Everyone keeps talking about the system and structure. The system and structure can go to hell. That's right. We're bound by the institution of marriage. We force ourselves to conform to the roles of husband and wife. Although entering this system may seem easier and more comfortable, it means the disappearance of our true selves. In fact, being true to ourselves is what matters. Husband and wife are ultimately strangers. We must communicate seriously, no matter how ugly it gets. What's important is to reveal our true selves. Even though we understand the principles, we can't put them into practice. "You must look at me closely." But because of the fear of embarrassment, I couldn't say it. You're right. I've been avoiding it. I use physical training to escape. I use work to escape. I don't want to think, to keep my mind blank. I… I didn't look at you closely enough. Charlie, once this type of raptor finds a mate, they don't separate. That's incorrect. It's true for eagles, hawks, and falcons. But owls, outside of the breeding season, live separately. They dissolve or distance themselves from their partners. They take it to a n extreme compared to us. Although Charlie eats more now, his appendix has become even smellier. And Hitoshi came here to buy things. He bought weed killer and a lint roller. I see. The mouse's movement is measured in 1 mickey, 2 mickeys. Really? We were just foolishly arguing and crying earlier, but why are we laughing now? Every day, all I want to talk to you about is trivial matters. I suppose it's because I want you to listen to me. If I were to present this divorce application, we would be labeled as divorced... or as having failed in marriage. But I truly don't care about that at all. I just want... for both of us to be ourselves again. I want to be with you, Hiyori. Do you want to be with me? What are they doing?
