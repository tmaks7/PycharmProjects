- Okay, settle down. Time to get started. All right, can anybody tell me, what are the zeros of each function? Come on, we've been learning this for like a week. Somebody? Clair? - The zeros of a given function F are the solutions to the equation F x equals zero. - Now let's look at problems with two pairs of brackets. We can simplify by regrouping the brackets and then grouping over here. - Fuckin' asshole! - Oh! - Principal, now! - This is quite a record. Your very first day in my school, and here we are. Transfers from seven different schools. And you have no frustrations? - Here, yes, yes. - I think you can do this now. - I got this. That goes there. - You sure about this? - Yeah, just do it. - You want small letters or caps? - Uh, caps. - You're home? - Hi, Mom. - How was your first day at school? - Good. - It's a farther bus ride than your other school, but maybe at this one, you'll start fresh, hmm, make some new friends. - Sure, don't see why not. Might even try out for cheerleading. - Really? - Sure, and next, I'll go out for homecoming queen. - Don't you want to fit in? - Mom, I fit in. I just haven't found the people I fit in with yet. - Well, honey, maybe if you didn't look like that, it would be easier for you to make friends, huh? - I don't want these kids as friends. - What's wrong with them? - Nothing. Ma, okay, nothing. - Don't take that. - Why? - It's Bill's. - Really? I don't see his name anywhere. - He likes a Coke, first think in the morning. - Well, how 'bout I like a Coke, last thing at night? - Just put it back, okay? - Why should I? - 'Cause I said so. - How come you always stick up for him, huh? Why never me? - Good night. - What? You're afraid if he doesn't have his Coke in the morning, he'll hit you again? - Casey, who I choose as my boyfriends is my business. My business alone! - Fine, we'll have a big blast when this one splits. That is, unless you have enough money to keep him fed enough to stay. Let's just hope we don't run out of money first! - Casey. - Marge! - I know where you got that from! - I want this bitch gone, now. Her or me, Marge, you fuckin' choose it, but I'm not puttin' up with her shit anymore. I treat you good. I don't give a fuck what that tramp says. - Bill! Bill. - What the fuck! - It means you're cool! - Yeah! - Only dead is cool! - Whatever it is, tell her no. - Hello. - Mom, I'm leaving. I'm not coming home. - I see. - Ma, I just can't stand it, Bill or whatever. I just don't want to come back. - Well, maybe that's right. You always said you wanted to see California. Honey, I'm sorry. I, I didn't mean it like that. It's just things are so hard here. So I've called your father, and he'll be at the station to pick you up. He says he's excited to see you. - If he's so excited to see me, how come I never came to visit? He never called. Never nothing. - Maybe he did in the beginning. Who remembers? I mean, he moved on. He got his own life, new family, new everything, so... - How many kids again? - Three daughters. - I love you, Mom. - Love you, too. Bye! - Let's go. - Dad, I'm hungry. - Heather, quiet. I told you we'd be late. See? And the train already got here. - We wouldn't have been late if you took the 5 like I told you. You, no, but you had to take the 101, when any idiot knows that the 101 takes forever. - What a dork! You know she could've waited for us, at least. - Now what am I supposed to do? - Yeah, maybe she changed her mind. She decided not to come. - Dad, I want a cheeseburger! - I'm so hungry, please. - 500,000 more calories. Okay, we're leaving. This place sucks. - After Marge called me and all, she's not gonna show? - Look, they probably got into a fight. - Can I go to Eva's house after, as well? - She probably threatened to come see you, and then they patched things up, and she's still in Ohio. - You think? Well, I should at least call, right? - Eddie, would you just call from home? - Okay, you're right. You're right. She probably didn't come. - You know, you have three kids of your own. Since when did we become a motel for other women's children? Eddie, come on, let's go. You wanted to watch the game, right? Come on. - Oh yeah, her dad called this morning. It's on the machine. I forgot. - Oh, did he say what he wanted? - I forget. Probably just to say she got there. But you spoke to her, so you know that, right? - Right. He's blocked well and tries to cut through the middle, oh! - Who are you? - Nobody much. My name is Samuel. - Were you watching me? - I suppose I was. - Why? - Well, I said to myself, look who's here, a little girl sleeping. I wonder if she's lost. Should I awaken her before I go? No, I don't think so. Sit your old bones down and wait. - Wait for what? - To learn your name. - That's all you want? - I haven't much interest in anything else. - Yeah, I've heard that shit before. - Please, please, I don't like to hear language like that. So tell me, we were discussing your name. - Come on, cut the crap! If you're looking for money, I haven't got any. - Money is not as interesting as people think. - It is when you don't have any. - You don't have any? But you have a name, no? - Casey. - Ah, and your last name? - I don't have a last name. - Interesting. I've never met anyone who had no last name. - Well, then I guess you've never met anyone before who hates their parents, huh? - Would you like another? - You mean fries? - Anything. - I don't want to be greedy. - When you are hungry, there's no such word as greedy. - Um, then can I have another cheeseburger? - Lena! A repeat, if you wouldn't mind. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. What a fat ass. - It is generally considered rude to be insulting to the hand that brings you your food. - So? She didn't hear me. - A thought is as powerful as a word. It can affect longer and stronger. - Well, if you don't care what I have to say, then don't listen to me. - What do you care about? - Shit. - I interpret that to mean all you care about is feces? - Don't be an idiot. - But then I don't understand. - It means I don't care about anything. - Well, that's too bad. - What's so bad about it? - Well, if one has so little purpose in life, there's no reason to live. - What do you care about? - Possibly less than you. - So why don't you just kill yourself? - I never leave a party early. - You call this crap a party? - Unfortunately, it's the only party I have. Thank you. So, where are you off to? - I don't know. - You're just going to go off like that, poof? - You know, it's not like I'm following your or shit. I'm just hanging. - No, no, no, I'm not judging you. - Why you gotta talk like that? - Like what? - You talk phony-like. - Oh, I beg your pardon. - Are you a foreigner? An illegal immigrant thing? - I'm a naturalized American citizen, just like you. Some people are just very fortunate, eh? Huh? - I guess. I don't know. You monster! - What's their problem? - You be careful. You be careful what you- - What the fuck's their problem? - Stop your pointing at her! - Why you go here? - You want something? You talk to me. - Go away, you stupid! - Hey, you talk to me, you hear me! - What the fuck's their problem? - They were unhappy about the swastika. - My what? - The swastika on your back. - What about it? - It's something they associate with Adolf Hitler. - That sign on my back, that just means fuck off. - Yeah, there are a lot of people who disagree with that interpretation. - And why do they wear those beanies? - As a reminder. - A reminder of what? - That God is above all. - Is this where you live? - You'll grow accustomed to it. The offer still stands. - You mean I can just take a bath here, and that's it? - What else would there be? - No monkey stuff? - First, you flatter an old man. Second, I invite you as a guest, not a prostitute. Let me go get my mail. Where are you? This is home. Come! - Wow, it's nice in here. How long have you lived here? - A long time. Here. Let me show you the bedroom. There, you can get yourself cleaned up. Ah. - Hey. - You drink coffee, huh? There's a drawer under the sink. It's got a new toothbrush. I'll keep your coffee warm. Get a chair, in the closet there Come on, come on. The food is getting cold. - Was that you in the picture over the sink? - It is. - Who's the lady? - That was Rhea. - Who's that? - My wife. - Oh yeah, what happened? You divorce her? - Never. She's dead. - Oh, um, shit, sorry. - Coffee? - Yeah. She, she looked pretty. - Rhea? Nah, pretty? She was beautiful. - How'd she die? - Step by step. - Oh. - How did you meet her? - In Germany. - Oh, really, you lived there? - Well, it's not easy to live there, not as possible as you may think. - What's that mean? - Nazis make bad company. - Did you fight with them? - They fought with me. What is funny, eh? - The whole six million dead Jew shit. - What? - That's not true. - Oh, really? - They just made it up, 'cause Jews are liars. - How do you know that? - My mom told me. - Oh, your mom told you. - Mm-hmm. - Hmm, boy. - When I first heard about it, I was like how gross, you know? - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Like burning people. - Yeah? - Making lampshades out of their skin. - Oh yes, yes! - So then, I thought how gross. - Mm-hmm. - Right, so I told my mom what the teacher said. - Mm-hmm. - And she set me straight. - How'd she do that? - She was like, yeah, some Jews died, like any war, but six mil, no way. - Yeah. Well, I'll tell you a little something. Your mom is wrong. I was almost one of the six million. - You're a Jew? - You're so shocked? - Uh, I've never, I've never spoken to one before. - So this is a red letter day for you, isn't it, huh? Whoop-de-doo! - Do you want me to clean up? - No, no, no, no, you are guest. I'll do the cleaning up. - Yeah, well, when people say that, they don't usually mean it. - Well, when I say it, you could be sure I mean it. - Uh, so I guess I'll split. - Why? - Thanks, you know, for the bath and the food and stuff. - Hey, anytime you want a bath, you're welcome. - Were those two babies in the picture your kids? - They are. - Where do they live? - They don't. - You mean they died? - Yes. - An accident or something? - Ah, I suppose Jewish twins could be called an accident, especially if it's during a war. - Well, well, take it easy, okay. - What? - Take it light. - What does that mean? - Don't let the bedbugs bite. - Yeah, understood. Bedbugs bite. - Hey! - Hey. - Uh, how much? - Uh, 50. - 40? - 45 now, or forget it. - Okay, Jesus. And turn that shit off. Oh, of course. And I'll let you finish this part. Let's get this party started, right now. Okay. - Hey! Hey! - Oh shit! - Give that back, you bastards! Hey! - Casey! Casey! - Come on! - Fuck you little fuckers. I mean, it's not like I like it or anything, the massage stuff and everything. It's just that, 'cause of my age, I can't get working papers without my parents signing off, and like, since I, obviously, I can't do that, what else was I supposed to do? I mean, the only jobs they had are some immigrant crap, but the guys wanted me to fuck 'em anyways, so I figured, hey, like this is better, and I only have to use my hand. And the way I look at it, Arabs wipe their ass with their left hand anyways. Oh, shit. I know that hurt. - Well, it certainly didn't feel good. - I guess we do have something in common. - Oh? - Hm. - What is the significance of that slogan? - I always know that I said it first, even if they think they said it first. I know I did. - Hmm. So how does Christmas in Los Angeles feel to you? - Um, it sucks. - Hmm. - Just like every other Christmas. - Uh-huh. - But I guess it's better here, 'cause I don't have stupid cornball gifts. - Well, who gives you these cornball gifts? - My mom. - Ah. - And whatever stupid ass boyfriend she has at the time. Like, one year, I remember, I heard my mom tell her boyfriend to get me a gift. She gave him 20 bucks, and he ended up blowing the money on himself. - Oh. - I opened the present, next morning, and it was bubble bath from her bathroom. - Oh my God. - You have any cool family traditions you do for Christmas? - No, it's, uh, a normal day to me. I have no family. - None? - None. - They all died on you? - Yeah, yeah. - Left you to carry this shit alone? - I thought that was rather rude of them myself. Mm-hmm. - Any kids? - Two. - How old? - Pamela's your age. She's 21. David's 15. - Why aren't you with them on Christmas? - Hey, is this a massage or a therapy session? - I just thought you might've wanted to talk, for a while, first. - We're not dating. This is a one-off, right? - I know. It's just, um, kind of hard for some guys to say that they want to talk, so then they come here, but, you know, then- - I'm not very good at conversation, especially not with my kids. - Have you tried? - I try. I try at home. I try with my wife. I try with my kids. I try all the time. I'm sick of trying. But here I am. I have to try. Merry Christmas. - Uh, yeah, uh, merry Christmas. - SOCO operator. - Collect from Casey. Unless a guy answers, then hang up. - Hello? - Collect call from Casey. Do you accept? - Yes, yes, yes, I will. Casey? - Mom. - Honey, I was hoping you'd call today. You know, today's the first Christmas we ever spent apart from each other. - Yeah, I know, oh, merry Christmas. - You haven't called in three weeks. Is everything okay? - Yeah, everything is great. Um, Dad, he took me shopping, to, to The Grove. He said I could get anything. - What'd you get? - I got, uh, two pairs of designer jeans, one with rips in 'em, you know, the cool kind, and one super skinny and stretchy. - Isn't that great? And school? - There's no school, right now, Mom. It's Christmas break. - Right. Did you have midterms? - Yeah, aced them all. - Casey! You know, I was, I was worried that maybe this wasn't the right thing for you, but I think, I think sending you to Los Angeles was the right move. - Yeah, uh, sure. Well, um, listen, um, I, I know this is a lot of money, long distance and everything, so, um, I just, and I'm really sorry about breaking the phone, so I just wanted to say merry Christmas, and I'll call you later, okay. - Okay, honey, just, um, just one more thing. Did you make those, uh, those apple pies like I taught you to, for dinner? - Yes, I made all three of them, apple, strawberry, and pumpkin. - Well, that'll go over big. - Yeah, um, I love you, Mom. - Love you too. - Bye. - I thought it would be nice if you had some company on your first Christmas Eve in L.A. - Thank you. - All right. - I didn't get you anything. - Well, if you'll have dinner with me, tonight, that will be present enough. - You're cooking? - I don't think the experts would call it cooking. But I can guarantee you plenty of food. I hope you like it. - Yeah. But, um, why'd you get me something when you knew I didn't get you anything? - What does one thing have to do with another? - You think it's just okay to get someone something, like a gift, and not expect anything from it? - Yes, and that's the way it should be, always. - It's cool. - Yeah. - But, um, what is it? - It's a necklace, of course, but it's a heart. - Yeah, but why is it a heart? - Well, you have one, don't you? - Doesn't everybody? - No. Aren't you going to put it on? - Uh, I think I'm just gonna hold it for a while, okay? - It certainly is. So you didn't hear from your father after you saw him at the train station? - Nah. - Hmm. And your mother still believes that you are living with your father? - She pretends she does, so she doesn't have to deal, so she can pretend everything's hunky-dorky groovy and just stick to her lame shit. - You know where he lives? - Yeah, some shit end of The Valley. - You have the address? - Yeah, so? - Maybe you should be his Christmas present, tomorrow, huh? Are you afraid of going? - I'm not afraid of shit? - Everybody's afraid of something. - Yeah, well, not me. - Ah, my goodness. - Okay, so what if I was scared of going? - Uh-huh. - Like, scared of how he would act or something? - Then I would embrace the tiger. - Huh? - It's a Chinese saying for learning to love our fears, our demons. - What for? - Taking the tiger within us and becoming its master so that you are in control of them, and they, not you. - What bullshit! - Perhaps, but it works. - So you're saying you're scared of something, and then after this tiger thing, you're not? - Somewhat like that, yes. - Of what? What could you possibly be scared of? - Of you. - Me? - Of your ignorance. And not just your ignorance, but the ignorance all over in the world. - I got it! - Is this Eddie Miller's house? - Yeah. - Can you tell him Casey's here? - Who? - Casey. - Dad! Dad! - What? - Dad, she's here! - Who's here. - That girl. - Hi, can I help you? - I, I would've brought something. I didn't know I was coming until I actually got here. - You sure you're at the right place? Who are you looking for? - I'm Casey. - Eddie! Come on, it's getting cold. - Ah, come on in. Um... Okay. Everyone, this is Casey, my, uh, my daughter. Casey, this, this is my wife, Linda. My daughters Zoe, Heather, and Stephie, who you met before. Are you hungry, Casey? I'll get you a chair. We could, uh, all just maybe move down. - Hi. Okay. Hi. Thanks. - So how ya been? - Good. - Uh-huh. - What grade are you in? - Ninth, maybe. Mm, the food's real good. - Hmm, thank you. - And, and your mom, how's she doing? Is she good, too? - Yeah. She's good. - Do you always dress like that? - Like what? - Do I have to share a room with her? - Dad, I just got a new room. I'm not sharing it, and I'm not giving it up. - I will. Do you like hide and seek? - Mom. - Girls, it'll get handled, okay? So, Casey, this is quite a surprise, after all this time. What made you change your mind about coming? - Um, something about a tiger. - Hey, looks like we're having a little slumber party. - I still get to keep the top, don't I? - Uh, no prob. - Uh, so do you want to borrow a pair of Zoe's pajamas? - Nah, I'm good, thanks. - Okay, well, then I will leave you girls to it. Good night, princess. Good night, Casey. I'll see you in the morning then. - You know, my mom told me. - Told you what? - All about your mom, how she's drunk and a weirdo, also how she got arrested for DPI. - DUI. - Whatever. She also once went to welfare and- - How old are you? - 13. - Oh, too bad, you won't know until you're 14. - Know what? - How to shut the fuck up. - You saw the girl. She's trash. Do you have any idea what kind of influence she's gonna have on our girls? - She's a kid. - Yes, she's a bad kid. You can see it all over her face. - Oh, come on, you can't see shit. - Eddie, there is no way that that girl will fit in here with our lives, no way, no how. Besides, you've never even been sure that she's yours anyway, right? - Her mother wasn't sure. - Yeah, well, she doesn't look like you. - But I think she's mine. - She doesn't look like you. - I think she does. - She's not even cute. - Oh! - Wait, wait, wait. Are you gonna tell me that you think she's cute? - She's my daughter. What am I supposed to think? - If you saw her on the street, would you think she's cute? - My God. Maybe, I mean if she cleaned up. - Just like that mother was a tramp, she's got tramp written all over her. I want you to tell her tomorrow that she can't live with us. She's trash. - You think it's just okay to get someone something, like a gift, and not expect anything? - Yes, and that's the way it should be. - Yeah, but why is it a heart? Open up! Open up! Open! - I'm coming! I'm getting dressed. Wait. Hold your horses. Don't be silly. - Open up! - I'm opening up. What's wrong with you? - I hate you! - What? What did I do? - I hate you! I hate you! I hate you for making me fucking go! - I didn't make you. - I hate you! I hate you! - No, no. - Fuck you, fuck you! - No, no, no. - Fuck you! Fuck you, fuck you for making me go! Fuck you! - What's wrong with you? Why are you doing this? Come here. Come here. What's wrong? Come here. Come here. My poor baby. - He still doesn't want me. - Poor little girl. - She said I was ugly. - Oh, stop it. You're beautiful. You're the pleasure in my life, right now. Don't you know that? The world will see your beauty, too. You're up? - Uh-huh. - How are you feeling? - Okay. - Some nourishment for you. - Thank you. - Casey, I learned little from the Nazis, but this I did learn. Sometimes, we get taken away from our families, as we both are cases, but then we get opportunities to pick a new family. - What's that mean? - We could be family to each other. - What for? - What for? So, so what happened? You got something better to do? - No, but you can't just make a family. - No? - You're born with one, like it or not. - And I believe that if you don't like what the cards tell you, you can ask for new cards. - Me? Out of all the cards in the world, why me? - I choose you, and I hope you choose me. - You're nuts. What for? - 'Cause I never had a chance to teach either of my daughters how to be a lady. - Oh, I get it. You want me to stop getting piercings and stop saying fuck and wear stupid, little white dresses? - Wrong. Even if you did all those things, there'd be no guarantee that you'd be a lady. - If you think you're gonna change me, you can forget about it, because this is it. Okay, plenty has tried before you, and look where it's gotten them. - Oh, oh. - Shit. - Are your bags all packed? Huh? How many bags you got? - None. - None, huh? Okay. - Hold on. If I move in, what's the strings? - Only two. - I knew it. Handjobs and blowjobs. - Don't you ever talk like that again. Don't you even think it. Do you hear me? - Yeah. So what are the two things? - You take the swastika off your jacket. You go back to school. Think of this as your room. - You're just gonna give me your bed? - I'll give you time to think about it. Think it over. - Yeah? - Better? - Yeah. Thank you. - You okay? - Yeah. - Come on. You the lady we're supposed to talk to? - Full name, please. - Casey. - Last name. - I never use it. - Nonetheless, it's necessary. - Casey Miller. - And you're her legal guardian? - Casey is in my care. - So who's her legal guardian? - Her mother. - I'm afraid she'll have to sign you legal guardianship. - Why the fuck should it matter what that bitch says or thinks? - Casey! Shh! What if she doesn't sign anything? - Well, Casey is considered a minor, and she'll be assigned over to juvenile authorities. - I see. - And I fucking don't. - Casey. Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you. Casey! - Fine, I won't fucking go to school. Fine by me! - That's now what our agreement was. - Okay, you heard her. I'm not the one saying I can't go. It's her. Fuck her! - We heard what the school's terms were. We can meet them. - Oh, okay, yeah, like how? - We'll go get permission from your mother. - That old man gets it up? - Bill, would you shut up? - Look, she's your daughter. What do I care? Do what you want. - I'm asking your opinion. - A Jew? Sure, if she can't find any niggers to shack up with, she'll be fine. - Hey, I'm sorry. - For what? - For the crap they're saying. - Well, it's a pleasure to meet both of you. - So, Ma, um, Samuel wants me to live with him, and the school just needs your signature for me to go. - What? You get paid or something for this? Some kind of foster shit thing? - I, I, I, I am not paid. - Then what's the deal? - Well, I, I enjoy Casey's company. And I believe that she enjoys mine. - Yeah. What's the real deal? - Okay, Bill, I'll handle this, okay? As you can imagine, I was very upset to hear that Casey has not been with her father. - Bullshit! You'd have to be dead in the water to know I wasn't living there. - I trusted you. - Fuck, you trusted me. You only trust me when it's what you want to believe, just like always. As long as I said I was going to school, you didn't fucking care what I did, as long as I said I was going. So you could just relax with it and be all fine. - Shut that fuckin' trap of yours, before I come over there and fuckin' shut it for you. - Okay, be quiet. - You gonna hit me? You think I'll stand for it, like my mom? Well, dream on, you fuck! And when you go to sleep, I'll goddamn kill you. - Walk out of this. Stop that. - You get 'em out of this house! - Casey! You want to live with this man? - You got something better to offer? What a raw deal. - There are worse. - What's the real reason you want me to live with you? - A promise I made. - To who? - My wife. - What'd you promise? - To stop hating. - Hating who? - Everyone but her. And when she was dead, there was no one left not to hate. - How come you didn't hate me? - I did. - You did? - Mm. Believe me, you're not as easy to like as you may think. - Oh. Well, then what happened? - God presented me with a challenge, that day at the graveyard. If I could learn to forgive you, a child with a swastika, then perhaps I could learn to forgive all, before I died. - Wow, heavy shit, man. - Yeah, heavy shit. - You think your wife would've liked me? - What's not to like? - I'm sorry. - Oh, no, no, that's my fault. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Uh- - My fault. - Uh, thanks. - Make any friends at school? - No. - Ah, okay. - But I didn't make any enemies, either. - Oh, that's good. What'd you learn at school, today? - Uh, algebra. - Ah. - I hate it. All these stupid a's and b's and c's and d's crap, like where am I gonna use that? Plus, isn't that what calculators are for? - Hmm, algebra doesn't teach you how to add and subtract. It teaches you how to think. - So in discussing Diane Arbus' photographs, what can one understand about her suicide? I expect more hands to go up here. Anybody? Casey. - Um, I think Diane killed herself, 'cause God could only understand her if she was dead. - Hm, can you expand on that? - Well, you take a person like her, like Diane, and she only likes people that were ugly, you know, ugly in comparison to pretty people and stuff. And because she thought that the ugly people were really beautiful, she thought that inside she was also ugly. So, you know, since everyone thinks midgets and stuff are ugly, except for God, Diane wanted to be beautiful, and only God would think so. - I see. - Can I ask you something? - Of course. - Do you think these people, these photographers, are born different? - What do you mean by born different? - I don't know. Like, do you think God gave them an extra gift or something, so they can show people what stuff look like? - No. I think God gives everybody the same gifts. Most people just don't unwrap the gift. - You headin' to church? - Yes, to temple. - Oh yeah, I keep forgetting the difference. - Yeah, so should everybody. I left some dollars on the counter for you to go to the market. - These? - Yeah. - Okay, thanks. - Hey. - Hey. I saw you go in, so I, uh- - Came in? - Yeah, but, you know, I, I also like books too, so. - I like books. - Do you, do you need me to take that? I can. - Uh, no, I got it. - Well, probably, but, you know, I can do it easier, so let me. - Okay. Thank you. - Um, do you, do you like pizza? - I don't know. - You don't know if you like pizza? - I, I don't know. - Oh. - I like pizza. - Who was that? - Nobody. - He's a good-looking nobody. - I can't. - Can't what? - You know, with, with, with him, I can't. - You can't what? Go out? - I've never been on a date before. - What about the... - You mean the massage thing? - Yeah. - That wasn't a date date. That was a job. - Oh, well then, it looks like you're about to go out on your first date. - No. - Yeah, why not? - No way. No, that is not happening. - Why not? - What if I vomit? - Why would you vomit? - Nerves. - What's there to be nervous about? - 'Cause of everything. - Name one thing. - I'm ugly. - Yeah? Who says you're ugly? - Everyone. - Well, everyone is wrong. - That's stupid. Everyone can't be wrong. - Oh, I can remember a time in the world when everyone was wrong. How does it look? - I don't know. - Can I see? - Not yet. - Will your granddaughter be taking the dress? - She is not my granddaughter. What are you doing? - Hmm? - What are you doing? - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm just lookin' around. - Ah. What's your name? - Tony. - Tony, huh? - Yeah. - Sit down! - Oh. - What are you walkin' around for? - Just lookin', sorry. - Yeah. - So, um, have you lived here long? - Long. - Yeah, yeah, it seems like that. So, um, you know, do you think she'll be out soon? - I don't see why not. Yeah. - Okay, good. - She's nervous, you know. - About what? - You. - Well, why is that? - Well, she's not up on all the so-called social skills. - Well, I never thought about her as socially anything. I, I mean, I didn't think about that. - So why you interested in her? - I mean, she's weird. - That's all? - She's weird, and she's cute. - That's nice. - I mean, I think that's as good as a reason as any, don't you? - Well, I've heard better reasons. I've certainly heard worse. - And I've done worse, too. - What? - Um, I mean, I've done worse, too, but you don't gotta worry. - I better not worry. - Yeah, not, not this time. - Why don't I go see what's keeping her? What do you think? Help me up. - Oh, okay, yes. - Take this first. - You want me to grab the cane, okay. - Yeah, then help me up. - Here, let me put that, right here. - Both hands. - Okay. One, two, three. You good? - Not bad. - Okay. - Casey, you must come out. - I can't. - Why not? - I look like a freak. - You look beautiful. - You're lying. - I'd never lie. - Okay, just, just, just give me a few minutes. - She's just freshening up. - Okay. Wow. You look, um, you look beautiful. You look great. So the bottom line is, I've been seeing you around at school, and I know that you're new, and I see that you don't have much friends in the way, so I figured that makes my odds pretty good. - What do you mean by odds? - You know, the chance that you'll be able to talk to me. The less people that you have to talk to, the greater my chances are of you talking to me. - You must have a lot of friends. - I've got, uh, I got plenty. But at the same time, I kinda got squat. - Yeah, friends are a kinda hard thing. - You? Do you have a best friend? - Yeah. Samuel. - Samuel? The old guy? - Come on, he's not that old. He's not. - Okay. - Good night. - He seems like a nice boy. - Yeah, he's nice. - Well, I think we have to talk about something. - Talk about what? - We'll talk about it tomorrow, all right? Good night. - Good night. - Casey has some questions. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. Ask the lady. - No. - Hey, she better get her ass back in here, before they shut us down. - What was that about? - Nothing. What makes you think you know everything? - Listen, are you capable of taking care of a child? I am not. I am too old to raise an infant. - What makes you think I'm gonna have a kid? - I saw the way you looked at that young man, and I saw the way he looked at you. - So? - So, either you protect yourself, or you'll get pregnant. - Okay, what if I just don't do any of, you know, those things? - Then that would be very good. - Good. - Good, very good. - And don't say you're too old. I hate that shit. - Ah, come on. - Do you miss it? - What? - Sex. - Oh, only when I think of my wife. - How often is that? - Not often. Just every minute of every hour of every day, not often. My, my, my. I've got another smooch here. You hear the birds? It's spring, and they're singing my song to you. It says I love you. I love you so much. God love you. I love you. - How many wars do you think there have been? - What, in history, or whatever we know of history? I don't know. 10,000, maybe 250,000, lots of them. - That's stupid. - Of course. - Why don't they just talk about it or like flip a coin or something? - You don't understand mankind, do you? - Man is generated by greed. He makes wars on what he thinks he needs, but actually, it's what he wants. And if he wants them, then he manufactures the need. It's stupid. It's selfish. It's wrong. And no matter what kind of flowery justification they may give it, it's evil, wars, holocausts, you name it. Not like the animals. Now the elephant, he sees a banana grove he wants, okay, he takes it. Yeah, but he doesn't know anything about lines of mark or demarcation, ownership, property. And if I was creating a new world, I would say to hell with this one, except for the fact that, if there's a new world out there beyond the stars, what if there's no elephants? That would be tragic. - Wait. Hey, did I embarrass you? I'm a jerk. - No, you're not. - I wish I understood you. - So you've never been to the beach? - Never. - No beach? - No. - Not even a little bit? - They don't have beaches in Ohio. - What do they have? - Nothing, really, I mean, nothing for me, anyway. If you had to die, which way would you choose? Drop out of a plane, drown in the ocean, or shot in the head? - Why are you so morbid? - Beats me. So which way would you rather die? - If I had to? - Yup. - None of those ways. - Then how? - By kissing you for so long that I run out of breath, and I die. - I, I, I, I've never, never been kissed before. - Can I kiss you on the forehead? - Sure, yeah. - Ready? - Yeah. - Why? No, don't, it's fine. It's fine. - It's ugly. - Well, maybe it was, but it's not anymore. - Okay, and why is that? - Because it's you. Where'd you go? - Thinking. - Yeah, about what? - How long you're gonna like me for? - Well, who says I'm gonna stop? - You will. - Well, why is that? - Once you find out. - Find out what? - Who I am? - Casey, you think you're the only one that has shit stuck inside? - Maybe. - Well, maybe nothin', all right? Most of the people I know, they're all shit. But if you're only half shit, then you're doing aces, in my book. - You don't think I'm mostly shit? - On the shit scale, you're less than half. - Hey! What are you doing down there? Has security seen you? Oh my God. My God, how dare you! - What's the matter, Jew? You scared? - No, no, I've seen your kind all over the world. I'm, I'm not scared of you or you or you. You're like children. You're like mad, little children. How dare you do this to our school! How dare you! I'm gonna report you, and I hope to hell they throw your asses in jail. - Aw! - I'll see that you'll never do this again, I'll tell you. - That's right. You walk away. - You'll never do this again. - You have a great day. Walk away, old man. - Yeah, go to hell. Security! Security! There are gorillas running around loose in the streets. America, where is your freedom? Where is your lack of prejudice, intolerance? America, I'm speaking to you. Security! - This is payback! Fuck you! Get this, baby, get this! See, see how it goes, you goddamned Jew Fuck you! That's right! Fuck with us! Piece of shit! - Fuck you, whoever did this. Just fuck you! Go away! - Casey. - Go away! - Casey, come on, it's me. - Go away, I said. Just get the fuck away! I don't want you here. - Please, don't shut me out. - Get the fuck out! Just go! - Casey, I'm not your enemy. I'm on your side. - Get the fuck out! Just go, okay? - Look, Casey, you need me, and I need you. So just please open up. - Get the fuck out! Just go! - Well, he's regained consciousness, but with a ruptured spleen, a fractured fourth vertebrae, I don't really hold much hope. - What's that mean? - Sorry, are you a relative? - He's my only family. - Well, he comes in and out, but he can still hear you. - I brought her flowers. I figured she might know you were sick and everything, so I took the flowers to her grave. That way, she'd think it was you. - Casey. - Hi. - Hi. - You hungry? I know the food here must suck. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, the food does suck. - Make any friends? - I, I, uh, I met a couple of cute nurses. - Should've been me. - What? - Those punks who banged you, it should've been me, once doing the banging for no fucking reason other than to bang. - Maybe, but not now. - You're going to die, aren't you? - With any luck, I do. - But you can't, okay? You can't. - Well, it's time already. I want to. - And what about me? - You've been dead too many years. Just start to live. - I can't do it alone. - You can. - How? - By embracing the tiger. - All right, so, uh, what are you guys planning on doing after school? - Probably... - Can I, can I talk to you guys later? - Yeah. - Yeah, you go ahead. - All right. Casey! Casey, where the fuck have you been? - Around. - What kind of answer is that? - Samuel's dead. - I know. Okay, and I am so sorry. - Easy come, easy go, huh? - Why don't you answer your door when I come by, or, or, or the phone? - Why bother? - You know, Casey, Samuel may be dead, but you're not. - Yeah, see ya. - You know, watch out that the shit part don't take you over. It's got a habit of doing that. - Look, if you want to stay, pay the rent! - He said, you know, when he talked about, but, you know, he didn't talk about it all the time, just here and there and stuff, but you know what he said that surprised me, really surprised me? He said that I wasn't the only one getting hurt by this stuff, you know? It was also the guy that- - Hey, watch it. Don't get any oil on my shoes. - Sorry. He would say that it was as bad for me as it was for you, and sometimes, even worse than you. - How 'bout a little bit less with the mouth and a little bit more with the hand? - And he said that for you to cum, you could get over me, but I could just wash my hands, and you would still be there. You would be full of shame. Shame would be on your mind forever. - Man! - Samuel's watching. Samuel's watching me. He's always watching. - Oh man. - Be brave. Embracing the tiger. - Through wars, through famine, through holocaust even, art continues, always. Art will grow and always continue. Why is this? Class? Because as human beings, we have a powerful need, don't we? A powerful need to create what we feel, what we touch, what we see, what we hear, what we... Casey! Hey, won't you come join us? - Roar! Tiger for yes.
