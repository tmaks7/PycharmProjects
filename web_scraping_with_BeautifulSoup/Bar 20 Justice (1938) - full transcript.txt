Yes, sir! And Kim Young-rae! Your mother hasn't brought the school support fee yet. Today's the last school day, so when will she? Maybe your mom thinks you don't go to school? School isn't free, got it? What do you mean you can't pay? You promised to pay ages ago! I got none. I'm flat broke. Then you shouldn't have bought it. Why'd you buy make up for that crater face of yours! You wench! Look who's talking! Why don't you go have 10 more fatherless kids! You booze-selling whore! What? So you wanna fight? Wanna get beaten again? Yeah! Beaten to death! I'm gonna beat you, today! Enjoy your ice bar. Ma! Cops! Ma! The police! Rotten bastards are always on patrol. Gosh, it's so good to see you. Can't say the same. You promised on paper last month you wouldn't sell this stuff again. No, of course not. But I had to either face a loss, or use them myself. Don't you think I should sell the rest at least? I know her very well. She's my neighbor. Think we're stupid? I oughta knock some sense into you. Wait. Be gentle! My arm will break! Ma! I'll be home later tonight! Go on home first! Damn! Didn't I tell you before? I told you not to sell ice bars when my Ma fought! No, I was selling them first, but then your Ma started fighting with Chun-ja. You think I don't know that you always rush in to sell ice bars at a fight? And you even brought Hoony along! Rotten bastard. What? You orphan! You filthy bastard! You fatherless bastard! I know you can't headbutt anymore when you hear that. You fatherless bastard! Fatherless bastard! You orphan, wanna die? Nah-nah! Nah-nah! This icebox, I'm gonna throw it into the toilet! Young-rae... Forward, Forward! Stop! Reverse! Young-rae! Did you get a report card? My sister got all F's. Shut up! Oh goodness, don't hit your brother's head like that. You straight F nuisance. But I got one D! You idiot! Nah-nah! You stay outside this late on the first day of break? Tonight's our family ancestral rite, so be quiet. Got it? Pa! My dear boy, how was your day? - You're late. - Everything ready? It's done. Mister. What about my Ma? When can she come back home? She got caught again? It won't be so easy since she's been caught so much. If she can't pay the fine, it'll take some time. It's not the first time she sold smuggled goods. She should've been careful. Oh, my dear boy, he just fell asleep. because, he played out all day. Smells good. They must be having a family rite. Why are you here? Young-rae, I won't sell anything when your Ma fights. I swear. I tried coming earlier, but I had to put Hoony to sleep. Young-rae, where'd you put my icebox? In the poo can inside the toilet. Really? You really threw it into the poo can? My boss is gonna make me pay for the icebox out of my wages. That icebox costs a fortune. I'm doomed. I found it! I don't have to pay for the icebox! Young-rae, I promise. Until I go to Busan city, I won't sell any when your Ma fights. You're being adopted to Busan? Only little kids are adopted. Darn it, it itches. I'll make tons of money at a shoes factory in Busan. Then buy the best shoes in the world. Strong shoes with fur to stop frostbites during the winter. Oh yeah! And waterproof shoes for the summer. I'll buy Hoony's, too. You must've saved up a lot of money. Not much but a little. Then lend me some. Are you crazy? Friends don't lend friends money. Don't you know that? Selling ice bars? Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three two, one... Oh, my back. Your eyes behind your head? Why'd you knock me over during broad daylight? Oh, my butt's broken. Why is your boiled egg here? Chil-sung, here you go. Your filthy hands make me wanna throw up. How can they be so dirty? Throw the egg away. I'll throw it into my mouth! Go ahead and feed those worms inside your stomach. Work hard at it. Oh boy, I'm dirty all over. Anyway, how come there aren't any pretty girls to look at? Look at her fat legs. They're bigger than a pig's. Come to think of it, Chun-ja's legs are much better. Chun-ja's Tavern Let go! - Hurry and gimme the money! - Come here! If you don't, my Ma won't get out of prison! Don't ask a broke girl like me, go ask your father instead. What? My father's dead, so how can I? what a wicked wife. Dead? Well, saying he's dead would be easier. Stop talking nonsense, and just give him the money. You ripped her offjust because she called you a crater face? Kid. Just go back home. She's shooting off her mouth because she's drunk. Kid, so hurry and go home. No, you gotta give me the money. Ask your father in Seoul and not me! My Pa is in Seoul? Think he's dead or something? How could Kang Sung-wook, the son from a wonderful family, die? Kang Sung-wook Chun-ja usually has a good heart. But when she gets drunk, that heart goes out the window. I'm never gonna fight with Chun-ja again. She paid the fine for me. You always said that and then fought again. You're right. Fighting is inevitable. Only if there's a good reason to. - Ma... - Yes? When did Pa pass away? My son must be going cuckoo since he's got an empty stomach. I'll make you dinner in a jiffy. Let's go. What was dad's name? Huh? Ma! Darn it, I was just about to fall asleep. What's with you today? I don't know my dad's name, so kids always call me a fatherless brat. What's my dad's name? I don't remember. You know I got a bad memory. Ma, just tell me his name. Just his name! I said I don't know! You do know! Kang Sung-wook! Think I wouldn't know if you didn't tell me! I know everything! Kang Sung-wook! Who said! They're all rumors made up by people. You always lie to me! You promised not to fight again, but you always do! And you knew dad's name, but you lied! You're driving me crazy! Why do you need to know his name in the middle of the night? Why can't I know? You better stop! Kang Sung-wook is his name, right? If you don't answer, then I'm right. Seoul University student, Kang Sung-wook! - Hello! - Hi there! * Bell is ringing. * Flowers are blooming. * Birds'song * and smile face. * I miss my lover. * Don't leave me alone. * We met the first time, * and fell in love * in the sweet and * friendly street. * In the beutiful Seoul Train to Seoul, 840 Won for children * I'm gonna live in Seoul. 840 Won! a sales person recruiting So please do what's in your power. I'll do my best, but I can't promise anything. Hey! Think we get saccharin for free? Pour it all in, why don't 'ya. If ice bars aren't sweet, why would you eat them? You've been smart with me lately. Is someone backing you up? Or did someone offer you a better job? I'm not being smart with you. I've done everything you told me. Then what do you think you're doing now? Just say 'Yes' and that's enough. And make sure the kids don't go to the backyard, okay? - Yes. - Sir! What do you want? I wanna sell ice bars. No openings. Go back home. What? Boss. Duk-jae just quit. Him and Hoony are being adopted. Hoony, too? Come back for more ice before they all melt! No selling on rainy days and return to the factory! And I pocket 1 Won for each ice bar! Right? What a smart boy. That's right Now go sell a lot. Yes, sir! How's a toddler like him gonna sell icebars? You're right. Hey, kiddo. Ice bars! Try shouting it out. Ice bars... Ice bars... Ice bars... Ice bars... Ice bars... Here! Which one? Just one? Thanks! Good day. Crackers! Crackers! Ice bars... Ice bars... C'mon, what's wrong? Turn your face this way. Your lips won't swell up if we kiss. Movie stars do this all the time. What if rumors get out? I'm dead if they do. Let's die together. I won't tell anyone. I know you lady. You live in that home with the steel door, right? No! That's not me! My home has a wooden door! Ice bars. Do something. Go away! You little rat. I won't tell anybody! Never come back here to sell ice bars! Otherwise, you're dead meat. I left my wallet at home. Can you pay this time? What? You don't have the knack to sell things. All you sold were two ice bars? When will I ever make 840 Won? 840 Won? What's a kid like you need big money for? To buy a train ticket to Seoul. Your mom told you to earn that money? No, she doesn't know about this. I'm making money to find my dad. Your dad? Yes! My dad! My dad lives in Seoul. He went to a really good university, and is really handsome. You talk too much, kid. It's late so hurry home. He can't sell, but he sure does brag a lot. Well, if I had a father like that, I'd brag like him, too. Our dad was also handsome. Be quiet on the job. No one's here, so why should I be quiet? Your looks take after dad very much so, but not your personality. Dad was so nice to people, and humble, too. Stop talking about that bastard! This is crazy. I'm not making any of my money back. Selling all this won't be easy, either. Do it at night, and run the factory during the day. Then people won't be suspicious. Who told you to use the toilet here! My stomach hurt all of a sudden... Come here. You bastard! What did I tell you? Didn't I tell you not to let the kids come back here? Already forgot what I said? What are you doing back here? But poo was coming out of my butt! You rude little brat! How dare you talk back to me! Sir, phone call for you from Seoul. Better be careful from now on! I just pooed a little. Your zipper's open. You! Come here, you bitch! Honey, she didn't mean anything... She didn't mean what? - What! - What I mean is... Come here. What are you doing in this area? Over there to drop by my friend's house. Oh my, look how dirty you are. You can't go like this. My goodness, how filthy. Your friend's mom will be upset. Stay still. Oh, so dirty. Let's see. How handsome! Don't stay out too late! You don't shout ice bar on purpose because I'm following you, huh? No, just that I have no energy left. Liar! You don't like me following you to sell ice bars, huh? Hey, I got two stolen from me today. Hoony can't fall asleep without holding my hand. You feel bad because Hoony was adopted? Stop following me and go sell on your own! Tell me a good place to sell, then I won't follow you. If I let you know, you'll never follow me? Yes! Kim Young-rae, 46 icebars. Wow, you sold a lot. You've done bad till now, but how'd you sell so much? It's a secret! Jang-sun Station Buy some cuttlefish. Ice bars! Over here! Enjoy! Hey, Young-rae! You jerk. Eat as much as you want. Listen to me very carefully. From here to that school is my territory. So if you wanna sell in my territory, you have to sell 10 of my ice bars instead. Got it, you fatherless bastard? If Seung-il asks you a question, respond, you fatherless bastard. You bastard! That's enough. Need a beating to listen? - This bastard. - I said stop! Man, what a tough brat. So then... Come to the sewage construction site tonight. Are you the boss? Why are you acting like the boss? Then please tell him again, boss. Know where it is, right? Meet us there. I won't. What? You won't? I know you're selling this stuff behind your mom's back. Then I can tell your mom that you're selling ice bars, right? Don't lie, tell the truth. You ate all of them, didn't you? I'm not lying. These thugs... You ate all of them and then blame it on hoodlums? You little punk, you lie? - Let go, you bastard! - Please. - Please have mercy! - Let go! Let go! - Let go! - Please! Please have mercy! You little punk... What the hell? Did you just hit me? How could I hit you? - I just bumped... - You bastard! You hit me for sure, but lie? Why hit Mr. In-bak when it's my fault? You little brat, watch your damn mouth! You dare grab my hand? You wanna die? It's not that. Just that the kids might go out and give us a bad name. Kids' words spread around the town quickly. Listen to me very carefully. No one in this country, feeds commies' kids like you and always put your wages in the bank like me. Got that? Yes. Move! What did I do? What did I do? Young-rae, I'll never do it again. You're really rotten. You're worse than Seung-il! Here, I left this for you. Take it, it's melting. Hurry and eat it. Hurry and eat it. Hurry. It's melting, hurry. Tasty as hell, isn't it? Anyway, what if you get scared to death? I heard dead bodies float around there. Shut up! Let me suck it just once. I've never eaten one before. Liar. I'm serious! Then suck it only once, and give it back. It tastes so good, Young-rae! It's so tasty I'm gonna die. You sucked it too much! I said only once! Darn it. You're too crazy about food. You're gonna turn into a pig like Chil-sung. No way, I got swollen because of hunger. I didn't do it on purpose, Young-rae! The ice bar got stuck between my teeth! Your boy is too good for you. Why? Do you envy me? Go to hell. We go to Seoul to work in a factory, but the pretty one meets a college boy, while the other meets a con and gets stripped of her money. Yeah, I really envy you. Did you open your mouth to Young-rae? What are you talking about! For a few years, he came down asking for you. I told him I hadn't even seen your shadow. I never opened my mouth a single inch. Your business won't last long. If I were you, I'd go to Seoul. Stop talking nonsense. Anyway, if you tell something to him, you're dead meat. Got it? Are you okay? Young-rae? Young-rae! You know, right? I'm the only one in town who made it to the end. So if you go to the end like me you can keep selling, but if you scream and pass out, then you can't. Wanna go inside? You can't, huh? I'll only go if you go in with me. Why do I have to go inside with you? Let's make a deal. You're a really funny bastard. What deal? If I pass through first, then I sell at the station alone. If you pass through first, I'll sell your 10 icebars instead. Are you testing me? Think I won't go in? Boss, do it. He'll pass out as soon as he goes in. Yeah! Then, go in. You asshole! I know you're there! Hurry up! Get over here! I'm gonna find my dad no matter what. I thought that it was a real hand, and was scared to death. So Seung-il never went inside. He must have lied. Did you buy new shoes? They're Seung-il's shoes. A high fever put him out, so that's why I wore them. Wearing the same pair looks great, huh? Young-rae! Young-rae! Young-rae! What are you doing all the way over here? Give me ten ice bars! What? Then five! If you don't have five, give me three. You have to pay money for ice bars. It's not free. If you want some, ask money from your mom. But she never gives me money. No money, no ice bars. Really? Then you'll give me an ice bar? Icebar! You little rat! Suk-gu! You're a sucker! Newspaper! Here you are. Let's go. Newspaper! A New newspaper! Ice bars! Ice bars! - Finished your diary? - Yes. Then go ahead and read it. Today I slept at home after eating breakfast. I had lunch after I woke up. I will eat dinner soon. You idiot! How did I bear such a bonehead like you? Cuz you ate a bone! What? I should just die. Oh my, how filthy. Absolutely putrid. You'll need tons of water to wash up. I'm sick of your mom taking a shower every night. Now even you? I've paid enough for the water bill. What? Enough? You use a lot of water and pay enough? Seeing you take a shower every night, you must like some guy, right? Oh, god! Ma! You're wearing daddy's underwear! Daddy's torn up underwear! Why didn't you say anything to Suk-soon's mom? Because she's the landlady. You're a dummy. You fight when you don't have to. And don't fight when you have to. Suk-soon's mother is stronger than Chun-ja. I don't wanna get beaten over a useless fight. And Suk-soon's father is a cop. I hate Suk-soon more than her mom. She looks like a pig. How could her mom like her? Even if the daughter looks like a pig, parents are meant to never hate their kids. No matter how dislikable, he can't dislike them. - Who? - God! If Suk-soon was God's daughter, he'd puke. Oh my, what are you doing? You wanna fight? Oh goodness! Oh, god. Oh! Young-rae! Have you eaten an ice bar before? Sure. What does it taste like? Like candy? Like cookies? They're 100 times tastier. Wow. Suk-gu, big noses went to the moon wearing pots on their heads. The world sure has changed. We go to the moon now. Isn't that a just TV show? If it's on TV, then it's not a show. They really must've gone. Now you're delivering smuggled goods? Hurry and go tell him no. All I need to do is deliver the bag, so don't make a fuss. Sell a lot! What will you do with the money? For what? I gotta hurry and go sell. All my ice bars fell! Suk-gu was wrong, right? About you going to Seoul. It's not true, right? It's true. Young-rae. I'm going to Seoul to meet my dad. He's in Seoul. But you keep lying. Young-rae! You have no dad! He doesn't exist! No! I have a dad! I must have a dad! Then you won't fight anymore, pay my school fee, and kids won't laugh at me anymore! They can never call me a fatherless bastard! Young-rae. I'm going to Seoul to find my dad! No! You can't go! What mother stops her son from meeting his dad? You're the worst mom in the world! What? You lie to me after I saw you trying to sneak on the train? - You punk! You punk! - What's going on? Who are you? his kid works at our factory. Be quiet and just tell the orphanage to send someone. Since this orphan bastard tried to be sneaky! I'm not an orphan! I have a mom and dad. Yeah? Then tell your dad to come. My dad is in Seoul, so he can't come. If your dad is in Seoul, then my dad is in America! You punk! You punk! You little brat, how can you be a habitual liar already? I'm not! My dad is in Seoul! I'm serious. My dad is in Seoul! I'm not lying! It's the truth! All fathers don't deserve to be called father. A man who doesn't know where his kids live, and how much they suffer can't be called a dad. He hasn't done anything for you, so why do you miss him? You hate your dad because he's a commie? Don't you hate your dad, too? How can I hate him if I've never seen him? And it just makes me happy hearing that I have a dad. So how can I hate him? Even if you find your dad, he won't be the dad you want. What do you mean? If he was a good dad, he would've looked for you. Even if he's not, I still don't mind. I need just a dad right now. - Just a dad? - Yes. Just my dad. You can't even control your son, so what do you expect me to do? How can you say that? Don't give him ice bars to sell. If one kid quits, will your factory go bankrupt? Give me an answer! Say you won't let my son work here! We're happy that he makes us money, and he earns money that he needs. So what reason do I have to stop him? You're harsh, young man. How much do you want to profit by bruising a child's shoulder? Well, how would you understand a parent's feelings? From what I hear, you're not such a good mother. Don't be like that. What gives you the right to say that? What I mean is that don't be harsh on your son for your own selfishness. Bringing food to the table isn't everything. If they knew that Young-rae existed, they would take him away. Like they took their son from me, they will take Young-rae from me. Here. It's for the face cream. When he came looking for you, you hid like crazy! Didn't realize your kid would look for him? I didn't know that day would come this early. I'm scared. Oh goodness! Hit harder! I thought you were all grown up, but you're still a baby with those fists of yours. You get drunk whenever you drink, but you drink again. That's enough. Bring a soda from inside. My guts must be clogged up Wow. He's your father? But I can't see his face right. Well, he kinda looks like the teacher next to our class. He doesn't look like him at all! My dad is very handsome! I can barely see him, so how do you know? Hey, hey. You've even got his photo now, so you better prepare to go to Seoul. You can't just go to Seoul. Why? You have to learn the Seoul accent to speak in front of them. Then they won't ignore you, and help you to your dad's house. What's a Seoul accent? I've learnt the accent watching movies. The accent's really easy. Just drag the accent at the end of the sentence. - Drag? - Yeah, say 'Did you eat??' like 'Did you eeeeat??' Or 'Do you want to go to Seoul??' Iike 'Do you want to go to Seoooul??' Did you eeeeat? How'd you say, You must be happy to have a dad.' You must be happy to have a daaad. You got it! You're so smart! You caught on fast! - Caught on faaaast. - Gonna eat the eeeeegg? Go buy your ooooown. Are you a piiiiiiig? You worked hard dealing with the goods until now. This job is very important. To avoid any suspicions, go to Seoul early, do some sightseeing for a few days, and then deliver the bag on time. Nothing to be scared about. It's just an errand. If I leave here, the police will get really edgy. They always keep their eyes on me cuz I'm a commie's son. You're coming out hard this time. Okay, I know that you two worked very hard for the past two years. If this job goes well, I'll return your bank account, and send your sister to high school. I know you don't believe me, but if you don't, that's your loss. Mister! Mister! Mister! Mister! Mister! Mr. In-bak! Mr. In-bak, over here! Over here! Kang Sung-wook, Seoul University The village that is under the mountain. Please find my dad, okay? Please! Huh? Mr. In-bak, please find my dad! Please meet my dad and come back! Please! I hope Mr. In-bak meets your dad. If my dad comes here, come and see him. Okay, and I'll show you my shoes first once I buy them. Great! Chil-sung! Chil-sung! I nearly died. Cuz you stuffed it all down. Your ugly shoes turned out really useful. You saved my life today, so you eat the other egg. Holy, What... What are you doing? - I'm sick of you smugglers. - Where is your boss? He hasn't come in yet. What's going on? He ran away already. Where's In-bak? What? You wore my shoes the other day, didn't you? - No, I didn't. - You didn't? You put a hole in my shoes and now you lie? But I didn't make a hole. I'll let you slide if you give me the egg. What egg? You wanna die? Mr. In-bak! Mr. In-bak! Mr. In-bak! Stop right there, you punk! I said stop! You bastard! Stop right there! Stop! You wanna die! Yor bastard! You wannna die? Come here! You're dead! You're dead meat. In-bak, You're caught red-handed. Where are you running off to? Song-su! - Catch him! - Stop right there! Stop, you bastard! Song-su! Train! The train's coming. - The train! - Move! Song-su! Train! Get out of there! - Train! - Get out! I can never go to Busan now. And kids will laugh at me, calling me a cripple. Don't cry. Eat this and don't cry. I'll give 100 headbutts. I'll give 100 headbutts to any kid who laughs at you. And then wash some lettuce really clean. Sailors will come to eat the food soon. Okay. How can a man like you eat so weakly? Chew properly. If you feel bad, you'll get indigestion. Young-rae. I want to live with you for a long time. Eating together like this, sleeping and fighting. I won't be able to live without you. I would be too bored. I can't talk to the wall or the ceiling. I'm gonna live with you forever. I don't mind if I can't live with dad. But I want to live with you no matter what. Then you shouldn't try to go to Seoul. Why did you come back? You should've stayed there. What did you come back for? Seoul isn't the place for me. The water tastes bad. And so does the food. You know I can't eat alone. Since I take after dad. That's why I came back. I'm fine, so don't worry. How's Song-su? He's okay. He eats well, too. I couldn't meet your dad. - No one was home. - What? So you found his house? You talk too much, you commie! Time's up! Mr. In-bak! Mr. In-bak... Young-rae. I'm sure your father's a good man. A really good man. Joong-Gu, Pil-Dong, 7-3 547 Kang Sung-wook. I'll make money by next year. Next year? Yeah, I'll catch birds and make magnets. I'll do it all to earn money. Money can't be made so easily. Smells good. Suk-gu's family must have had meat tonight. How'd you come all the way here? How else? On foot, of course. Check this out I have three legs. Take this. What is it? I need only one shoe now. So I don't need this money anymore. Take it. What if your dad moves next year? Hurry and take it. My armpits hurt like hell. Go back inside. See you later. Ma. I promise I'll find dad and come back. I promise. Ma'am, where is this place? Where? 547... Go that way.
