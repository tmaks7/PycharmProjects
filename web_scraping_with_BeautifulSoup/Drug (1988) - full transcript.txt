And now just sitting at home.. Hey you! What's your name? - Friend. - Are there any other talking dogs? I don't know. We don't ask each other. It's not polite. It's between the dog and its owner. Is that why people love you so much. Used to be normal, but now... I see everywhere your muzzle! - And birds, hamsters, fish? - They can talk too? Cant they talk, can they talk. people - that's the thing. - We have the same mother! - Huh?! Say that again, you, son of a bitch! - I said, we have the same mother-nature. - Right!

So then what are you? Mukhtar, Julbars? I'm Friend. Even if dying I won't call you that. I need to... get down. What for? I just need to! Alright. Truce for half hour. How dare he call me breedless... That was my last pair of sneakers! You go left, I go right. Something happened?

Looks like a bottle to me. 15-20... That's it! Look you see that Star? The brightest one! You know its name? Damn, I forget... Used to know. - The truce is over, let's go home! - Hold on! Let me enjoy the view! Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time to walk me everyday! What a dog-character. Go ahead. I gotta fix the lock. About time. And need to insert a glass into the door... it's cold. - Should I get on the ward-robe again? - It's up to you. You know my conditions. Die. Alright! I had enough! What am I supposed to do? Promise me, your gonna quit drinking. That's it? And because of this you held me hostage for so long? Had you told me before, I'd have given you 100 promises! Only to break them... I know your "type". No, you must swear on the most precious thing you have. What is that? You must know... what do you treasure the most? I am waiting. I got nothing to swear on. You've gone too far. I tried to break through a locked door, I was laughing and crying... I was yelling at walls "Now what!?" There's a storm outside, And an owner will not let his dog die! Around me the buildings grew, Covering half of the sky. I lost my mind completely I broke my guitar, I woke up, it was too late... Cold, cold... I am afraid to freeze, open up... Open please, open... Hide me away from the cold... And my youth, give it back, don't destroy it... I am cold, so cold... I stretched my fingers... And put my head down. and then raised it back and fell asleep... All because I saw a spring coming... I wanted to lean over the Cross cover myself with soil... Cold, I am so cold... I am afraid to freeze, open up... Open please, open up Hide me away from the cold... And my youth, give it back, don't destroy it... Cold, I am so cold... And when finally, someone heard And opened the door after deliberation, And only the family gathered around, And the most loyal friend, And in his embrace I realized... I am dead... All drivers, Yield! yield to bikers! Attention! drivers! Yield please! Yield to pedestrians! I am exhausted. It's enough, I can't continue! It's okay. Keep going. Your sobering up from alcohol. That's it! Can't go on... You want me to die! It's okay... I am tired too. Enough. We'll gradually, increase the workload... Good! Starting from tomorrow, we'll start water-procedures. - By the way, did you buy everything? - I did, I did buy it. Made of liver, don't worry. I paid 40 Kopecks for it, almost a beer! - I am not talking about food - About what then? I am talking about soul-food. You thinking of buying a newspaper? Thank you. It's so strange. What is? People, write what they think. Interesting, where was it printed? - Did you read the name of it? - Yeah. Newspaper "The Truth" And you're surprised by the "Truth"? By the way, is there anything about you there? What should there be about me? I don't know, the news from a Rehab. You don't deserve anything else. Oh, you breedless piece. Here we go again... "breedless". You know what they wrote about me!? I... I was only kidding. I am gonna prove you! You're gonna find out who I was! You think I am nobody. What? Alright. Enough! That's it... I can't take this anymore... Am I entitled for a walk or not? - Will you pay for the service. - Come with me to dinner. What a life. Look! Ah!? Ivan! Burgundy! Gentlemen! Wow, look at that! Good film, deep... - You wanted to walk! - Walk?! That's a walk! And I am forgotten... - A cat! - Where? Wait! No... He'll find me by the smell. - Mom, Where is the dog running to? - Its own business... CLOSED - Where are you going? - Restroom! Got me, scum! Mitka, I need your help! I am being tortured. Get the money, I don't care how and go to the "Skinners". I need a trap or a net. I'd call you but this "thing" understands everything. - Are you coming? - Yes, I am... Won't let me sleep. May be it is not a dog... a robot. Made after the Government and sent after alcoholics. You can do it! Come one! Who is this? Who? Go ahead or else! - You're in a good mood today! - I am sobering up from alcohol! You told me. Look there, see that mail box? Alright, let's race! Let's go a bag of bones! This time I outsmarted you, my Friend. It's a good thing we're buying bowls! Good when things are straightening out. Although, without a woman's touch it's gonna be hard. Screw women! There are other things to talk about! - A home without a woman, is just a house. - Not my expertise. Why? As a result of alcohol? You are a man! Leave me alone! So annoying! What do you want with me? Happiness. Look a candidate, the owner of the poodle. She is pretty, the owner I mean. What am I gonna do to? What am I to say? You never met any women in your life? You bet! Why? Never! Attention! Pull yourself together. - May I? - Huh? - Ah, yeah... - Go for a walk Jerry... You have such a nice dog. Male? And yours? The opposite. So a bitch? I mean... Sorry, slipped out...

I'll be frank with you I noticed you... couple days ago. You were coming out form a store. You impressed me. Sorry but you're a miracle. You're ideal. I was enjoyed watching you. Your like a re-born legend. Do you remember the myth about a Golden Age where everything lived as one? How do you find that understanding with the dog? Would you mind sitting down? I have so many questions for you. I think she likes you. Yeah? Alright. - Hm, some champ.... - Again? Not for me. Out of question. Yeah? Yeah change your shoes. Have guests looking like that is not ethical. Miss... Miss... May I ask you? Miss! Had I invited for dinner wearing these shoes, would you come? Mister, where are you going? The cashier on the right. To get another opinion, from a friend. Miss, do you have anything else, For the same price? Certainly... Wait... Go to the counter, please. - True animal trainer! - The famous Kuklachev? Fool... Kuklachev trains cats, this one trains dogs. He is helping him choose. - Are they too tight? - Kidding me? Adidas! Only Adidas, looks much better with a bottle. - Here you start again? - A woman will come over. - Is she coming to drink? - Just something for the table. How about tea? Oh yeah!

Hey, may be we should buy you something too? A ball. A ball? Yeah, though I am not young I still wanna play sometimes. Let's go? Come on... We have a hard day tomorrow. I am so grateful to you, I see things differently now... I found out so much, about things I never knew... To be honest, Neither did I. Before we met each other... I asked my dog about their life. You see? So I would know what to talk about, with you. Not about this right? You're incredible! That is so by nature! To ask your dog! So true! We should listen to the nature this way. Like any other nature lover, you are timid of your feelings. Oh, please! I like you, my dear man! Would you like to have a cocktail? An evening cocktail. I don't live far from here. Oh, yeah. Of course. What for? For the cocktail. At evening you said. Yes. This is a tip for consultation. Thank you very much. But I am in a hurry, so... Good bye. Jerry, sit! We'll see each other. Go! Don't rush... Let it cool down. Can you explain to me, what happened? Nothing. I don't exist for her... Don't exist as a man. Got it? Just like that. I don't understand... what do you mean? Here you are! You won't understand. You think you can speak to humans and now you know everything about them? Of course. Isn't that true? You're a little silly. Wet behind your ears! Close your eyes. Go ahead close them! Now open them. A ball! And for your birthday today I will bring you bouquet of roses, As white as the veil, Which you put on for our wedding day... And me. And was the world so kind, In which the two of us where spinning In bliss.. And for your birthday today I will bring you bouquet of roses, As white as the veil, Which you put on for our wedding day... And me.

A nightmare... everybody disappeared... and I was all alone... surrounded... only by dogs that could speak. Listen, can I... pet you? Life sucks... What exactly? Everything. What do you think... does it take long to send a letter from Moscow to Moscow? It depends... I think about 3 days. Are you, expecting some news? News? Who knows... May be not really. Let's go for a walk. - So, right or left? - Straight. Over there. People are getting ready for work. It's just us, slackers... - By the way, do we have any money left? - Money? Not a penny. It means, time to think of a job. What's your occupation? I worked at Mosconcert, actually... I sang at a theater... I played the accordion in summer in a Pioneer Camp. I played so well! The French listened to me! Who? Yeah... They said they didn't have such players. - Do you still have the instrument? - I pawned it. - Long ago. - Hm.. This poison is merciless. - How did you get so low? - What am I the only one? Others don't drink? Go and ask them why. See what they say, if they don't lie. I just discovered life. We'll buy you a new accordion, I promise... We'll get a job as a Security Guard at night... Earn just enough to get by, and buy a new accordion. I am still a dog... A human needs another. - Do you know what I mean? - You're still at it! Quiet! People are sleeping. Listen, may be we should start going to theaters... or subscribe to philharmonic. They say, you might meet your destiny there. I don't need anyone... and no one needs me. Even my wife left me. - You had a wife? - Why are you screaming? You think I was like since childhood? Damn lock! I had a wife. And a daughter, Lena. She is now, may be six... already... or seven... Go to hell, with your talking! Is she your daughter? Disappear... Hide somewhere... She'll get scared. Take off the bag! Hello! Is this for me? Chocolate for you. Thank you. Have we met somewhere before already? Oh! You're a new plumber right? I am... your dad. Your dad. Dad!..

What is this? - Mama, let's go home. Mom, mom, let's go... Let's go, mom... Let's go... It's killing me. My heart is bursting. Let me have a drink. I am repulsed to live. My dear friend. Be strong, just a little more. Pull yourself up. It's gonna be fine. Already human. No! No! I can't do it. I can't live. I don't wanna. Understand. I don't wanna.. I'll get rid of you anyway! In the snow descending from the sky Deep white snow Lies my sadness I am running to you, In a great hurry. While the soil falling asleep by dawn Covering itself by the snow Trying to warm someone up Only I am running away from sadness Praying to be taken by the storm If you want you can stop listening to this song. If I slam the door, it won't ease my pain Only don't shake the feelings again. Just don't hurt me again. And again the stars are falling from the sky I hope I'll be able to make my wish in time It's not too late to live I think. I just won't be able to live a simple life Don't open! It's the "skinners"! I beg of you, don't open! I beg you! Do not open please! It's Mitka... No, they came after me! I can smell them. Why do you betray me like this? I haven't done anything bad! It's Mitka! - I didn't want to. - It's alright! Quiet! He came to visit! Why? Hello Kolyun! We got the letter! Came to help you. - And who are these two? - Clients... Just deposited fur. Pros, nothing to worry about... Calm down Kolyun! Guys just careful okay? No pain, no harm. Take out of town and let go. Don't worry sir, it's gonna be fine! - Here is some money. - What for? Commission. Now run to the store. I will kill you! Stay away! Someone draw me a painting of a perfect house! So perfect right to a "T"... Show me where I can lay down And fall asleep without the noise of the streets. Draw me a picture of a house that would be alive Where none disturbs my peace. Where I can recuperate the strength to go on, And where no one ever would spite me I wish I could do it myself but I am afraid I can't I can't pick the right colours I am riding my horse in the same dark woods And wake up in cold sweat every other day from nightmares Draw my picture even with a bad shade On a brick wall as long as it is toughing So that even my fist would show, And from cold eye-brows it would blow and show my warm house I wish I could but I don't have the colors I know only two and I hold them both One is white, the other is black two lines of my life I wish I could color them But I don't have the right colors Draw a picture of me and right to a 'T' So that even my mother wouldn't be afraid for her son Draw me as a crane for an instant I want to look at people I want to look at people I want to see people from the altitude of a crane's beak I wish I could, But my brush is broken Only a finger-board can suffer the revolt of fingers And the leaves are flying up in the sky In the clouds Of these notes, bitter notes flying off the broken strings On the carpet of yellow leaves in a simple dress Of the silk that wind presented on occasion Autumn danced beneath the trees a simple tender dance Day was losing its ground In warmth of saxophone sound And from all around the city people came to us And enchanting sounds of music filled the twilight To a golden dancer, birds would clap their wings It was the day which has passed It was the best of our past I fall asleep and I see In that repeating night dream The dance of autumn colors on the street The trees are losing their leaves And gramophone spins its disk: "Hold on my dream don't go away, Stay longer please..." I fall asleep and I see In that repeating night dream Hold on my dream don't go away, Stay longer please... api.OpenSubtitles.org is deprecated, please implement REST API from OpenSubtitles.com
