Great start, don't you think ?? ?I want to do a lot with my life, but I'm not sure what yet.? ?For now, it's my high school exams.? ?I've lived here for a year:? ?You came to America for work or for love.? ?I came for love.? ?I've always done everything for love, above all, suffer.? ?I feel like Wile E. Coyote,? ?he gets destroyed over and over but he always bounces back.? ?I always bounce back too, convinced? ?that I'll meet the right person? ?and this time, I think I have ! ? ?I've had many men in my life,? ?Dorian Gray, the young Holden, Mister Darcy, to name a few...? ?Don't get me wrong,? I'm not scared of real love ! ? ?I like to dream, I want to be able to say: "I've been to the moon".? ?Maybe even only once.? ?Maybe soon I'll be landing on the moon ! ? ?I know you'll be wondering what Marta, me and Sara have in common.? ?A lot, I assure you but above all one thing... him.? BLAME FREUD It's like my relationships have sell-by-dates, like milk. They go sour after a few weeks. - It may be that... - It's not my fault ! - Sometimes we tend to blame others... - I'm not doing that, I just don't like anyone for more than a week. Maybe you're too focused on yourself. Greta says I'm unaffectionate. Maybe because I didn't have a mother ? I think you need to be a bit more self-critical. What a drag, dad ! You always contradict me. But surely you want my opinion. - You get paid to keep quiet. - But by my clients. - So what am I ? - My daughter. So a daughter who has relationship troubles can't talk to her dad about them because he's a shitty shrink ? Don't swear ! - She can, but not as a client. - What's the difference ? - Not in my office and not lying down on that bed. - I'm comfortable. Talk at home, in the armchair. - I see. - Emma... Bye ! Did you know that the most common illness in the world is love ? Don't worry: it may be inevitable but it's not fatal. Of course, sometimes it can be serious and incurable but most times it's like a sort of flu or cold. It won't last forever, you'll just be left with a few dirty tissues. - Now can we talk? - Okay. Well, I've met a guy. His name's Alessandro. But he's got lots of flaws and he'll last two weeks. No, on the contrary: he's sweet, cute, nice and he's lasted two months. - I think I'm in love. - I've never heard you say that. - He's an architect. - Is he in his first or second year at uni ? No, he's already an architect... In fact, that's the point. - There's quite a big age gap. - How much ? 32. - He's 32 years old ? - No. 32 years is the age gap. You're with guy who's 50 ? The same age as me ? - No, you're 5 months older. - Emma ! What the hell ! Don't swear ! Here she is, she's calling. - Good morning, family. How are you ? - Hi, sister ! - I'm starving ! - She's made me lose my appetite. - She's told you about Alessandro ! - Did you know as well ? I was the only idiot who didn't know ! Don't laugh, it's dead serious ! I saw a photo, he looks okay. How can you tell from a photo ? I want to meet him. - No. - Why ? - It's too soon. - It's two months too late ! Dad, relax, chill out ! - Are you excited about tomorrow night ? - Just a bit... - Really ? - Loads ! - Where are you going ? - To Phoenix, in Brooklyn. We went there on our first date. How romantic ! I want a relationship like that. Dad, have you seen the lady with the dog again ? - What lady ? You told her ? - Are you still following her or have you spoken to her ? - Go for it, it's about time! He's been divorced for 20 years but he doesn't feel ready. I have three daughters to raise, I've no time for a fourth woman. Stop being the perfect dad ! Give us a chance to moan about you, we need it ! A dad who is too perfect can do more damage than an absent one. Have you finished ? Thanks for the discretion. Confidentiality is your problem, not ours ! You're looking good ! - I miss you, all of you ! - Bye. On the long wall we'll put a Presta, - a really successful product. - Excuse me. - Yes ? It's obvious that we can't have two Cubes here. So I say we put a nice Babitz here, two Monets next to the bed, - so that leaves room... - For a Falcon that guarantees space for your clothes, - What do you think ? - I like it. You see that I found a solution for you ? - You've become better than me. - This might as well be my home. Don't do that in here ! - I told my father about you yesterday... - What ? - Yes, but don't worry. - What did he say ? - He wants to meet you. - He does ? - That's a good thing. He could've said: "Stop seeing him." "Or: "It's your life," "ruin it as you please." - "Ruin it" ? - But honeybun... - Don't call me that here ! - Good morning, sir. Do you know how many parents would've freaked out ? But he didn't, that's nice... - When is this meeting scheduled for ? - Friday. It's too soon, let's not rush him, - give him time to process things.. - Don't worry, he's an expert in that. He raised three daughters doing that. - So, to my father ? - Cheers. - Did you move the opera librettos ? - Where do they go ? Next to the thrillers, another two have disappeared. - Disappeared ? - Yes. Stolen, goddammit ! That's the third time this month. I'm going. I'll be back... I don't know when. - So you're going to pick him up ? - Yes. - Are you sure about this ? - Yes. - Did he ask you to ? He told me when he was arriving and how. Why would he do that ? To promote the release of his new book. - He told me he was missing the Roman air ! - That figures ! The intoxicating and joyous Roman air. What do you think ? - How do I look in this skirt ? - Not good, not good at all ! ?You always surprise me, Sara. And last night you did it again. You're fantastic, generous, you always go for it and never hold back. You're a wonderful person. Too wonderful, perhaps. And I don't want to let you down. Marriage is... too much for me. Goodbye.? - How did it go ? - It was awful, really awful. Love isn't what these shitty poets want us believe it is. Love has teeth, teeth bite and bites hurt and wounds never heal. It's by Stephen King, it seems fitting for this moment. You're not well. I wasn't well at all, I felt like I'd felt too many times before useless and empty, after the umpteenth break-up and the mantra I repeated every time: "Jodie wasn't right for me". And then I thought about Elena, Irene, Stefania, Elettra... They weren't right for me either. But maybe it's me that's not right, maybe I'm not right for anyone. A guy doesn't tell another woman he misses the joyous Roman air - ..if he's married with kids. - Marta, honey, sweetie pie. - How long have you known him ? - Since the launch of his last book, 1 year, 2 months and 23 days. And during this year, 2 months and 23 days, has he said anything more meaningful than: "Thanks for your collaboration ?" Of course ! Once he wrote "your precious collaboration". And he wrote: "I was waiting for your email". What does that mean ? That he was thinking about me... How could a guy like him be married ? Like any ordinary guy, with an ordinary wife... ..and ordinary kids. When I saw what he was like I couldn't believe it ! - What was he like, Marta ? - Ordinary ! Him, who's capable of writing things like: "Her solitude was like a long winter. A long winter followed... by another winter...". - No wonder he missed the joyous Roman air ! Come on, dad ! Marta, please ! A long winter followed by another... Let me make something clear: mine isn't a gay story. It's a tragedy, and like all tragedies, it's unisex. And this isn't the usual metaphor of a woman who cuts her hair to break free of her past, it was an offer: three cuts for 99 dollars 90. And during the last cut, seeing that gynaeceum filled with excitement, those happy wives prepping themselves for their husbands, a thought struck me. It wasn't Irene, Stefania or Elettra that weren't right for me, it wasn't women in general. Maybe, the only way out, that I'd never considered, was the one the hostesses were pointing at: men. - Sara ! - Dad ! How are you ? - Fine. - Let me get that. What are you doing here ? Shouldn't you be choosing wedding favours ? Yes, but Jodie decided to leave me. - What do you mean ? - She upped and left ! - I'm sorry. - It doesn't matter. It was obviously meant to be. - You've taken it well... - You're right, I have ! Dad, sit down. I've made a decision that will change my life forever. Go on. - I'm going to be heterosexual. - I don't understand. - I'm through with women. - What do you mean ? Enough ! I've tried, real hard, but it doesn't work. So I'll try with men, perhaps it'll work. I'll be heterosexual, like all other women. Aren't you happy ? - No... - You're not ? I can be understanding, but only up to a certain point ! Just because I'm a shrink doesn't mean I'll accept everything ! - You can't change sexuality... - Sexual orientation, not sexuality. It's the same thing ! It's taken me 20 years to accept you're a lesbian so you have to stay a lesbian ! - Sexual identity is a serious thing. - Who gives a damn ! If something doesn't work, you change it, you have to help me ! Where did I go wrong ? I wonder where I went wrong. Sigmund, where did I go wrong ? Tell me ! It's not you that's wrong, maybe it's me. Help me to understand men, please ! I've got a lot to learn ! Thanks, dad. Who told you men are any better than women anyway ? Who told me ? You, all of you, everyone ! You leave your jobs, give up your careers, look after the family, the house, the children, and all the rest... If you do all that, it must mean that men are totally amazing. Otherwise it'd make no sense. - May I... - You may. Good evening. Dad, this is Alessandro. Alessandro, my dad. - Good evening. - Hello. I'm going, I have to finish my homework. - Bye, honeybun. - Bye. - She's gone... - To study, she's a student. She has homework... honeybun. I admit I'm aware that this is all very strange... - Good. - We didn't set out to be together, we just found each other. Emma is special, intelligent, and above all mature ! And that must be down to the upbringing you've given her. She told me you raised your girls singlehanded, Francesco. Are we on first name terms ? - Sure ! Is that okay, Francesco ? - My name's Francesco. - Checco ? Checchino ? - Not Checchino, please. It was love at first sight, I'm sure you've experienced it. Never with an 18-year-old. You study these things ! At 50 the Peter Pan syndrome's normal. Yes, but don't go out with Tinkerbell... She told me you loved to crack jokes ! Pleade... - Is that a wedding ring ? - Yes. - You're married. - Only technically. - What does that mean ? - That it's over. - You're separated. - It's as if we are, yes. - Are you separated or not ? - We still live together. - Oh God ! - It's a very big house. Oh God ! Do you have a wife and kids ? - No kids. - No, you prefer other people's kids... - Francesco... - Don't touch me. - Emma makes me happy. - She makes you happy... Very happy. And do you think an 18-year old girl can be happy having a 50-year-old lover ? Not lover, don't use that word ! I just have to find the right time to end a relationship that's already 99% over. - 99%? - Yes. - You have to give me that remaining 1 %. - What? - You want my daughter ? - Yes. Let me be your therapist then. To try and save your relationship, - ..starting from that 1% that works. - It's pointless. Many relationships can be saved. - How long have you been together ? - Me and Emma ? - You and your wife. - 7 years. - A crisis at 7 years is typical. - Actually, it's 6 years. - 6 years is typical too. - 5 years... - Bollocks ! Sorry ! - All crises are typical. - It's pointless. - No, you owe it to me. - What'll I say to Emma ? It's got nothing to do with her. It's between me and you. - All right ? - All right. Are you sure ? I never want to hear: "You're wonderful, but I'm leaving." - A man could say that too. - No. I could never be that wonderful with a man ! - So you still like women ? - But I know it'll never work ! You know me, I'm gay, but why ? Did I play with soldiers ? No. Did I buy guns ? No. I love ballet, and the colour pink ! I was crazy about Hello Kitty ! I played with dolls... I just made love to a woman first. I liked it and I looked no further, maybe I'm lazy. Maybe I'm gay because I'm lazy ! It's time I got to work. - I need to reassess my position. - I give up ! - Me too ! - Here they are ! - Hi, dad. - Here we are. - We're here. You know that fundamentally I disagree. - It's morally wrong. - Yes. - And that... - Yes ! - Good. - Shall I lie down ? No, let's be serious ! I think men can be divided into 4 categories that cover 95% of the male universe. Category N. 1: frustrated men. All day long they say: "My life is crap, my wife doesn't love me, "my kids hate me." A woman who falls into this relationship becomes a saviour. She doesn't say: "I love you". She says: "I'll save you". Category N.2: Peter Pan. Luckily, they don't have a middle-age crisis because they're eternal teenagers. For them you're a joystick, winning you over is like completing a computer game. They prefer young women. Extremely... young. Now on to Category N.3: "I'd like to, but I can't". They're usually married with kids, but on the verge of separating. On the verge of telling them, of the verge of leaving home. They're always on the verge, but they never do anything. Because the kids are still young, she wouldn't understand... Then, when the kids graduate, you'll maybe realise the time will never be right ! Then they are the nice, handsome, intelligent ones. At last ! What's their problem ? - The mother. - The mother ? A constant and irreplaceable figure since childhood. That's when they start turning their young men into monsters. "How beautiful is this little willy ?" "How big is this little willy ?" The whole repertory: "You're handsome" "you're so intelligent, clever..." So, if for half of your life a woman makes you feel like God... Why accept that another one - makes you feel shit ? - You've talked about 95% of men. - What about the other 5% ? - They're the decent ones. Happy hunting, darling. - Goddammit ! - What's up ? "Don Quixote", "Samson and Delilah", another two librettos ! That's the fourth theft this month, it must be the same person ! - A serial thief ! - Go ahead and joke ! We're struggling to get by. - Just pay me board and lodgings. - You risk losing that too. Good morning. - I'd like "50 Shades of Grey". - The hairdresser's next door. - Sorry ? - Your natural colour suits you. - Actually, it's a book. - Really ? - I don't know it. - Can I order it ? No, I'm sorry, we're closing. Keep that up and we will close ! We can't sell everything. This bookshop's been here for 60 years. Grandpa would turn in his grave. How, we cremated him ? I love you ! - Hi. - Good morning. - Did you just eye him up ? - Me ? I only said hello ! - You eyed him up. - Come on, he's a customer ! - So you know him then ? - He's been in before. He never buys anything, but he comes in. - So he must be here for you ! - Yeah, right ! Listen, don't be dumb like dad ! Come on. If you need anything, just ask ! Go on ! Go on ! No, I mean... if you need anything, just ask ! Goodbye. Well ? Nothing, I was too shy. - This one ? - He's got a girlfriend. - This one ! - Don't point them all out to me ! I'll tell you which one might be okay. Stefano, he's nice, he's a journalist. Maurizio, sensitive, funny... - You don't like any of them ! - But they're all dogs ! Funny, sensitive, intelligent... but they're ugly ! This one doesn't even have any hair, this one's got a paunch ! No ! I want a handsome guy, he has to turn me on. I don't know about screwing men, let alone ugly ones ! - I'll remind you I'm your father. - Big deal ! I have to spend Saturday night with him. The problem isn't Saturday night, but Sunday morning. - Do they all have something wrong with them ? - 95 out of 100. - I've already told you. - You have to find the good ones in the bunch. - It's just hard to know at the start. - We start off perfect ! - They never talk about football. - We talk about love. - They're great listeners. - We're fun. And they're interested in whatever we do. I've found him ! - Who ? - The poet. - He's presenting his book tomorrow. - Shall we give it a go ? - Shall I organize a dinner ? - Okay. I'm going out, bye ! Bye. I don't know how long I'll be able to resist. - Dad, you're so old-fashioned ! - Old-fashioned ? There's a 50-year-old guy outside who's going out with my daughter. She's an adult ! She can make love with whoever she wants ! - She's making love with him ? - I don't know. - Did she tell you ? - Tell me if she did ! No. Even though, knowing Emma... I'll kill him. Now do you see why I wanted a son ? You almost succeeded with Sara ! Don't be mad. - Something happened to me today. - Really ? - Promise me you won't laugh... - We swear ! I was at my usual bar... - The lady with the dog was there. - And ? She got up, walked past me... and as she went by I heard her say: "I love you". - Who did she say it to ? - Well... She walked past me, I heard her say: "I love you". Who d'you think she said it to ? She's not said hello to you but now she says she loves you ? That's what I heard. - Are you sure ? - Of course, very clearly. She walked past... I love you. Dad's hearing things ! - Francesco, I love you ! - I'm scared ! - Francesco, I love you ! - You swore you wouldn't laugh. Six months after I was born, she left. At first I thought it was because I cried too much. Then I found out she'd gone to work in an NGO in Cambodia. She's a doctor. - Are you angry with her ? - No. - Do you miss her ? - No. - Yoy don't? No, I don't know... I don't even remember what it's like to have a mum. My dad was my mum and I had two great sisters, that's enough. It must've been really hard for her to give everything up... If it'd been hard, she wouldn't have gone. You are a bit angry, you see ? No, I swear ! Well, she had a dream and she wanted to fulfil it. Pure and simple egoism. - It's a cool story to tell as well. - Is it ? My mum, the heroine who left to save lives around the world... Even though the real hero is my dad who saved our lives. Good morning. Goodbye. Leaves. The pavement divides you. Like a yolk, red vivid, alone, unique... oh, souls ! Oh, leaves. So you hang... Dad. - Hi, dad. - Darling. - What are you wearing ? - The first thing I found. And where did you find it ? Here's my poet friend, let me introduce you. Sara, listen ! Don't do all the talking. When he stops talking, keep quiet for 10 seconds. Can you do that ? Look interested in what he says. - Go, make daddy proud ! - Excuse me. Enrico, hi. - You look lovely, as always. - Thanks. - This is my sister, Sara. Hello, Sara. I'm going to get a drink, see you later. Just back from New York... The Big Apple ! Extraordinary. A lively city, violent yet gentle, cruel, yet fragile, don't you agree ? A contradiction. Just like life, like our lives. And New York is life. Times Square, Broadway... The New York Yankees. And then Soho. Amazing SoHo ! And downtown, the Empire State Building... ..King Kong... What did you love most about New York ? I said, what did you love most ? I'm going. Or I'll get told off. May I ? Hi. - I brought you a little something. - You shouldn't have. Yes, I know. Hi, how are you ? - Come in. - Shall I sit there ? Sorry, I'm a bit nervous. It's my first time. - So, how do you save a marriage ? - It's not easy. - I know. - There's no fixed rule. And it's not always possible. - You know why people fear therapy ? - No, why ? They're scared of what they'll find out. - You know what I fear ? - What ? That I'll find nothing. - That I'll see there's no solution. - Can that happen ? Of course ! I let them go, I set them free. - People don't have to stay together at all costs. - I know. - Sometimes they lose power like batteries. - Right ! That's a great metaphor ! That's what happened to me and my wife. - When something's over, it's over. - There's no point insisting. - Love is not eternal. - No. - We have to accept that. - I'm glad you've realised. It's been a pleasure, thanks for the great help that... ..you've given me. - And we'll do it together. - Do what ? - Accept that your marriage is over. If it has to be, then I'd prefer my daughter to be with a free man. - Do you understand ? - Yes, but I don't need help. - It's not an easy task. - In fact, it's very difficult, Alessandro. - Ale ! Can I call you Ale ? - Yes, of course. When two people get together they are like two colours that are mixed and then become difficult to separate. We risk always bringing with us traces of the other person. - We're not solvents. - But I don't know if I feel... - She's my daughter. You owe it to me. Let's get to work and rid ourselves of this woman. - How ? - With the last time treatment. - What's that ? - An American treatment, unbeatable ! You'll do the things you did when you were crazy about her - But for the last time. - Why ? So that you realise that these things no longer make you happy and that life is great without her. Let's start with a dinner. - A place where you went during the good times. - But I don't remember. - A place you both liked. - We liked going to... ..Zia Teresa, in Maccarese. - I know it. She made great maccheroni with rocket, tomatoes and clams. Book a table at Zia Teresa's. - For when ? - For tonight ? - Tonight ? Tonight. Let's begin. - You think it'll work ? - All I can say is that I hope so. He has to feel like he's lost his woman for good. Then maybe that'll cause a reaction, otherwise there's no hope ! I don't think it's right, morally speaking. So you think approaching a girl outside the school gates is ? Don't get upset, it's not good for you at your age. I'm the same age as this man who's with my little girl. Who has grown up. I'm going, I have a client. - This is for you, and this too ! - Goodbye. Good morning ! My colleague's just popped out. But she'll be right back. This isn't my bookshop, it's hers. I just help her out sometimes. If you need anything... Put that book back ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! He's the thief ! Stop ! Thief ! Who's he ? Sensitive man... "I'm sorry, I assure you you won't see me again". - How are you ? - Fine, thanks. What's this racket ? - Turn that thing off. - It's Epic. - Don't you like them ? - They're shit. Well, it's Emma's favourite group. She could listen to them all day long. Maybe they sound better not so loud. For her, that isn't loud. - Shall we begin ? - Yes. - Shall we talk about us ? - Yes. - Did you see your wife last night ? - Yes. Just think, no more places like that ! No more great spaghetti dishes, risottos... No more fish restaurants, or top chefs. From now on just pubs and crisps, giant hamburgers... Live music and energy drinks ! If you get there early, they're free ! - Of course, and early is... - Midnight. But above all, no more silent dinners, where you don't know what to say. - Actually, we talked. - About the weather, what a drag ! - No, we talked about the restaurant. We remembered the times when we used to go there... It was pleasant. - Should I be worried ? - No, it's just the nostalgic effect. - When it's over, it's over. - That's right. An evening of shared memories won't change things. In fact, it's memories that make us move on. - And metaphorically, we'll delete them all. - How ? Take a box and fill it with: videos, photos, letters, cards, and then destroy them. When a woman leaves our life, her past must also leave. - For good. - Of course. At the end of dinner, I never order a dessert. - Then you have a taste of his. - And then ? Watch how they react ! I've understood more things about men from a Sacher cake than from books. There are the mean ones who give you the evil eye the greedy ones who eat quickly in case you finish it. The selfish ones who pull their plates closer, looking irritated. You know what a loudmouth does ? He shouts: "Can I have another ?" - You want another sandwich ? - No, sorry. With the writer it started with a pannacotta he didn't want to share. I should've known. - Did you report the thief ? - No. - Why not ? - Because he's not a thief. He steals, so he's a thief. - He's deaf and dumb. - How do you know ? - I followed him. - No way ! I did ! There's something strange. He takes a couple of librettos at a time, one day it's "Don Quixote", then "Samson and Delilah", another day it's "Don Pasquale" and "Turandot". He could take them all at once, so why doesn't he ? You're right, it is a bit strange. - It's like he's following a plan. - Or a programme. What do you mean ? "Samson and Delilah"... My librettos ! I told you he wasn't any ordinary thief. Excuse me ? - Is this okay for delicate fabrics ? - For those, white wine is better. - It doesn't stain so much. - Honey, the bread... - Francesco. - Yes. - Do you know each other ? Yes, Francesco Taramelli, my old classmate ! How are you ? How are you ? - This is Claudia, my wife. - So she's your wife... - Francesco. - Hi. - What a coincidence ! - Do you live locally, Mr Taramelli ? - You can call him Francesco. - Or Checchino! - It's a long story, don't worry. - Do you live locally ? - My office is nearby... Well, nice to see you again, maybe we'll have dinner some time ? Would you like that, honey ? - The till's over there. - Okay, bye. - The till's there. - Goodbye. I've often been criticised for being the one who wears the trousers, maybe it's true. - But is that a problem ? - I don't think so. I've always been very generous in love, I've never held back. I've never just dipped my toes in. - It's the ocean or nothing. - Did it pay off ? Yes, theoretically. But at the end of the day it's always me who does the work. - That's never been appreciated. - What do you mean ? My sacrifices have never been appreciated. Who changed their job ? Me. Who changed their friends ? Me. - Will you have a dessert ? - He will. Me ? Yes... - The tiramis?. - And for you ? - Nothing. - And the bill, please. It's really good. - Here you are. - Thanks. Okay, let's see... I had a bruschetta, cabbage and potato rolls, you had the Patanegra, pasta with mushrooms... and the dessert. We both had wine, for you 44 and 32 for me. I know, it's rather expensive... But it's the Patanegra that made you spend more. Damn, didn't you see how much it cost ? I tell you what... you pay 40 and I'll get the wine. No, let's do this... I'll pay 100 and the rest is the tip. Goodbye. - Do you need a hand ? - No. Actually, yes. What's the future perfect ? The future perfect... that's easy ! Because... well... The future perfect tense is the future tense that is perfect... like the present perfect, but not like the simple past... - I'll look on Wikipedia. - Good idea. Wait a minute ! Talking of the future, when we move in together ..will we make this our house ? - Of course, I get 1 5% discount. - Let's play a game then. - A game ? Show me how you'd arrange it and I'll show you how I would. Okay. We have 20 minutes from now, go ! Open up. I won't do anything, open up. Open up ! "I won't do anything to you" "Go away then" "You owe me a libretto" "It won't fit under the door" "Open up" "Fine, I can wait" "Move" "I'm deaf and dumb" "I'm hungry" Time's up ! I've finished ! Almost done, don't be impatient ! Voil?! - Is this your dream house ? - Do you like it ? - Well, it's nice... - I'm advantaged because I work here... Now it's my turn, right ? This is mine. Nice... - Do you like it ? - Yes, it's bright, colourful. I like the idea of putting all these objects together... It's really very nice, summery, colourful... I love it. - So I'll be in charge of the decor ? - Okay. Why my bookshop ? I'm... What do you mean... a bit crazy ? I'm... Distracted ! Nonsense ! I saw you. Yes. First you took "Turandot" and put it in your bag. "Then you slipped "Don Pasquale", under your jacket. Your house ? Well... goodnight. Tomorrow evening... are you free ? Okay. You'll be working ! What about tomorrow morning ? I'll take you to a place you'll like then. It's a place where you don't need to speak or hear. But just to see. At ten. Good morning ! - Late night ? - Yes, and you ? Early night. At first I thought he was Prince Charming... - Good morning. - Hi, dad. Can I have some coffee ? Then what happened ? - The grand finale ! - Meaning ? When the bill arrived he split it. - Mine was more, I had Patanegra ! - You shouldn't have ordered that. - That's what he said. - Who is he ? A friend of mine, I'm sorry. But I'll make it up to you. - I found the right man for you. - Who is he ? - Roberto, he's perfect. - Why ? - He's just left his girlfriend. Of course ! If you're still single, there's a reason. - There's a catch. - The nice ones get snapped up... ..and the flawed ones are free. It's best to grab them straight after a break up. - So you're seeing him tonight ? - Tonight ? He's dying to meet you. - Don't let him get away. - I'm nervous ! - I'll go and get ready. - It's seven o'clock, have breakfast ! - I hate biscuits in my coffee ! - Go and get ready. Your cheeseburger with egg, onion and chips. Good morning ! - 'Morning. - Been running, Mr Taramelli ? I came up the stairs. Call me Francesco. Yes, of course. You're the only one of my husband's childhood friends that I've met. I am ? I didn't know. The only one ? - Have you eaten ? - No. - Shall we have lunch ? - I'd love to. - There's a nice caf? near here, they do good food. Have you ever tried to use your voice ? You have ? As a kid ? And then ? Why ? No. My voice doesn't sound nice. I was ashamed. And I decided... not to use it. Never again. But many people learn to speak. And well too ! "Not me". I don't understand. Are you nuts ? I'd like to hear you speak. Just once, please. Yoy... ..don't... ..push me ? Speak, no. I mustn't push you to speak. Okay. And then something happens but you don't notice when it does. Your relationship changes without you knowing, that's the problem. You just realise it's changed. If you're careful, you'll notice. Perhaps we prefer to not know. I even thought of marriage counselling to have a different point of view. Mine changes all the time. Sometimes I see a wife's perspective, other times a woman's, or even a lover's perspective... I even see an outsider's perspective. You need group therapy rather than marriage counselling. Just think, I've never been able to tell Alessandro that I love him. - Never ? - No, I just can't do it. - What about him ? - At first he joked about it, he didn't make a big deal, he's been good, he's never put pressure on me. Then he bought me a dog "and called it "I love you". - "At least I'll hear you say it to the dog." - So the dog is called... I love you. I love you ! I love you ! Who's she ? You want me to sit down ? It's wonderful. - Well, this is my office. - This door ? I walk past here every day but we've never met, how incredible. I know. Well, thanks for the chat. Bye, see you. Well, well, Freud ! - I'm terribly sorry. - I've been waiting for an hour ! - Don't crucify me. - You were with a woman. Was it a blonde or a redhead ? - You're far too reserved. - You're the client. - Shall we begin ? - I gave her a present yesterday, as you said. - Did you get rid of all the memories ? - Yes, they're in that box. - You were supposed to destroy them. - I couldn't do it. Do me a favour, you do it. - But something strange happened. - What ? In the box I found the DVD of our wedding. - So I watched it. - And that's strange ? - Yes, I've never watched it before. - Why not ? It bored me, every time Claudia showed it to someone, I'd leave. Don't wedding videos bore you too ? Yes, but maybe I'd make an exception for my own. - Anyway, I watched it. - And ? I was moved. Just like a kid. Claudia was beautiful. - She really is beautiful. - I didn't get that. - She still is very beautiful. - Of course, she's not changed much. I was crying proper tears. You felt nostalgic, that's understandable. - Is it ? - In fact, it's real progress ..towards true awareness. - Awareness of what ? Of the fact that your wedding is really over. So the fact that I held her tight when we were in bed afterwards... - ..means it's over ? - Of course. - I was worried ! - No, it's normal. Is it normal that I felt like making love to her too ? - Did you ? - No. - Good. - But I have to, one last time ! Well, there's time for that. Really ? Well, we haven't touched each other for a long time. At first, we did it all the time ! - Does this subject embarrass you ? - No, why ? - You therapists have regular sex. - Regular as clockwork. At first we did it all the time, you wouldn't believe it ! She had this funny way of moaning... a sort of shrill... - Enough ! - Sorry, I got carried away. - And then ? - I'd sleep like a log ! - No, what changed ? - In our relationship ? - Yes. What happens to everyone, I think, everything became routine and repetitive. And normal. Well, how do I look ? - A bit boyish ? - How about a skirt ? I refuse to strut back and forth in different dresses like in an American sitcom, with you sitting there shaking your heads ! I like this outfit, it's elegant. - I feel comfortable so I'm wearing it. - So why ask us then ? It's an excuse to talk. You have to help me with the technical details. What time should I pick him up ? Sara, it's them who should pick you up and it's them who should choose the restaurant. Right. - It's ringing. - So it should be. Roberto, hi. It's Sara. At 9:30 ? Perfect. - Make him feel important. - I'll stand right next to the buzzer. - Don't overdo it. - But don't be late ! - Somewhere in between. - Okay, see you later. Bye. You shouldn't talk to me while I'm on the phone ! You said you'd stand right next to the buzzer ! I'm at the office, the audit guys are in so I don't know if I'll make it, you know how it is... - Shame, the Masterchef final's on. - The final ? I thought we could watch it whilst we pig out on the sofa. I know, but I don't think I'll make it. I'll get some treats in anyway. - And if you don't finish too late I'll leave you some. - All right. Bye. - Hi, honey ! - It's so cool here. They've played a few tracks and they're awesome. I can hear them, they're real loud ! It's pumping ! No, they're having a break now. - How long will you be ? - I don't know if I can make it tonight. What ? I've been really looking forward to it ! I know, but the audit guys are in, you know how it is... No, I don't know how it is or who they are ! I promise I'll try to come. - Bye, honey. - Okay, bye. - Is he coming ? - He said he'll try. Good evening and welcome. This way, please. - This is your table. - Thanks. After you. - This place is really nice. - Thanks. - The wine list. - Give it to me. For you. If I get a bottle, will you have some ? Just a drop. Don't straight women drink ? I can finish a bottle myself ! Here you are ! - Back already ? - Yes, I tried to speed them up. Great, come and sit down. - How's it going ? - They're down to the last two. The girl made ravioli stuffed with grouper, sea urchins, scented with thyme and bottarga shavings. - What about the other one ? - Crepes with asparagus crispy artichokes and white truffle. - And we're eating nachos. - But we have tortillas too. - That's good ! - Have some dips... My ex's name was Jodie, it still is, but I just want to forget now. Sorry, isn't Jodie a woman's name ? - A woman's name ? - Like Jodie Foster. But it can also be a guy's name. - Like "Joedi Maggio". - "Joedi" Maggio? We'd been together for over a year then out of the blue... - How did it end ? - Badly ! Relationships always end badly or they wouldn't end. - Am I right in thinking that he left you ? - The day I asked him to marry me. Ah, you asked him to get married ? He asked me to marry him. They day he asked me to marry him ! He asked you to marry him then left you on the same day ? - What a bitch ! - Who's the bitch ? - Me, what a bitch I am ! - You ? - Me ! I'd even said yes. Excuse me for asking, but why did it end ? Because he wanted a kid at all costs. - Strange, usually it's women who insist... - She did insist. - Who's she ? - Him... I mean. It's not that I didn't want to. I said that maybe marriage would be a good incentive ! But he was dying to get pregnant ! To get pregnant ? - To get pregnant, no ? - To get pregnant ? What's it called when you want to stick those things into ovums ? - To get a woman pregnant. - That's what I said. "Not even a goodnight text" - Hi. - Hi, are you new ? - Yes, it's my first day here. Bless. An orange juice, please. ?I forgot to mention something,? ?when a girl turns me on? ?I start sneezing.? - Do you want it with ice or without ? With. - It wasn't a total disaster. - Don't lie, I know. About what ? - You talked about your ex all night. - My ex-boyfriend ! - Well, it's the same. - No. I worked real hard trying to get the pronouns right. You can't depress everyone with your story about Jodie. - You know what men are like. - No, I don't know ! I told you: make them feel special. He said you're not over your ex yet. And that you're confused. And you should go easy on the booze. I know, I messed up, but he was no good anyway. But Roberto is fantastic. Too fantastic, too handsome, too tall, too perfect ! - Have you seen his ass ? - What about it ? Your boyfriend's ass can't be smaller than yours. We'll find one with a bigger ass. No, forget it, maybe I need to accept I'm not cut out for men either. - Great, come to the bookshop to do that then. - Okay. Here's your juice. Excuse me ! Excuse me ! I come here for breakfast, I always have juice... - Thanks for the juice. - No problem. Seeing that I drank half of it maybe I can get you another. To be honest I'm still quite thirsty and hungry too. How about you ? Bless you ! An allergy, I hope No... really don't think so... - Where shall we go ? - You decide ! Okay... come with me. So you've ended the nightmare of evenings in front of the TV too ! What a drag ! Maybe you wanted to go out all night, drink energy drinks, but no. You got roped into sitting on the sofa with your wife ! And don't say it was all right because I won't believe you ! Well, we can continue with your therapy. - My therapy ? - Yes. Yesterday I bought two tickets to Paris, because Claudia adores it. We'll spend a few days by ourselves. It's too soon. You said that being together somewhere nice would make us see that we can't be together, not even on holiday, out of our routine. That it was important to end it ! Too important. Alessandro, please... you're confused. You need more sessions before organizing a trip by yourselves ! - I'll take Emma to Paris. - Who ? - Emma. I promised her. - We'd planned it... - Planned it ? Emma... she doesn't even have a passport ! She doesn't need one, it's Europe ! Plus, we've never spent two days together, this could be the right occasion. It could be, but is it ? Who should I take to Paris, Claudia or Emma ? This is a very delicate decision. We shouldn't rush into things, we need to reflect ! I know that ! - Listen, would these tickets be refundable ? - No. No... It's all right. Really, it's all right. I booked for tonight. Is 8:30 okay ? Do you like Japanese food ? What's up ? What is it ? What's the matter ? You were late, I said it's all right. You were late and I should be angry ? Well, maybe something happened. If you screw up, I get mad. If I screw up, you get mad. Hi. - Are you always in a rush ? - I just finished with my last client. If you've finished, would you like to come shopping with me ? - Of course. - Why don't you come round for dinner tonight ? - Do like fried courgette flowers ? - Of course. Hi, dad. - What are you doing here ? - We need to talk. Well, I have a couple of things to tell you. Not on the couch, please. Come on, just for once, I'm tired. The first is that there's a guy I like. I'm always a bit worried about your infatuations. And then I've found out who stole the books, he's stopped now. - Did you report this criminal ? - No. Why not ? - Because it's the guy I like. - The thief ? - Yes, but he's not a thief. - He steals, he's a thief ! - But only librettos. - Why doesn't he buy them ? They're not essential items. For him they are, he's deaf and dumb. - I don't understand. - He was born deaf. - You're joking ! - No. - You are. - No, help me understand him ! Because it's hard, he's distrustful, very touchy. He's really sensitive. We fixed a date for tonight but we fell out today. I really like him, but I don't know how to be around him. Listen, Marta... your little sister has brought home a 50-year-old boyfriend. Your other sister wants to change sexuality. You're in love with a kleptomaniac, who's deaf and dumb and touchy... You know what I think ? That I'm sick to bloody death of playing the role of the modern, understanding father ! Who understands me ? Fathers have to behave like fathers, not friends ! Don't you understand ? I won't help you, because this guy's not right for you either, just like the writer, the philosopher and the juggler. I'll remind you that you brought a juggler home ! - So ? - What's wrong with an ordinary guy ? You want a dad you can moan about ? Okay, now you have one. Thank you. Hi, dad. You won't believe it, but today I met a guy I really like. Why wouldn't I believe you ? Even though he's a guy, I like him. It was fate, you know when you hit it off right away ? - Do you like this ? - Nice. - What's wrong ? - Nothing. I know you, what is it ? I had an argument with your sister. How typical of Emma. I was talking about Marta. She likes a guy, a thief, and she wants my approval. So ? Aren't you pleased that she wants your approval ? We're a disaster, I know, but plenty of dads would love to have three daughters who still need them. Think when we won't ask you anything anymore... Has she already gone out ? To Lanificio, a vintage restaurant, she looked beautiful ! Where are you going ? - Well ? - To dinner with the dog lady. - White or red ? - To get her drunk, red's better. - Her husband will be there. - White then. Can I give you a piece of advice ? Now that you're going out with... - Luca. - Luca. Don't get carried away. Often we men mistake enthusiasm for frivolity, then we have our wicked way and call it a day. Have a nice evening, darling. Would you like an aperitif to start with ? - Yes, thanks. - Any preference ? An aperitif. Don't worry, darling. Ignore me, carry on reading. You want to know how to behave ? Be normal: get mad if he makes you mad, and tell him off when he's wrong. And don't be over-protective. They tend to be anxious, especially if they don't understand. Those who can hear forget about other people's deafness and the problems involved. They're not able to do that. You've brought him to this beautiful, romantic place... for him it's just a dark place. Where it's hard to read your lips. Don't treat him like he's deaf, but don't ever forget that he is. Have a nice evening, darling. Hi, good evening. Please, come in. - May I ? - Come in. - Follow me. - Thanks. - Shall I... - What ? - Shall I put that in the fridge ? White wine, nice. Alessandro's been held up at work, so he'll be late. - At work ? - Yes, but we can begin. Honey, come on, it's ready ! - Here, this is for you. - For me ? - Why ? What is it ? - Open it. Are they chocolates ? A map of Paris, nice. - What are these circles ? - The places we'll see together. - Of course, when we go. - You promised it'd be soon. Real soon ! Of course. "For the attention of the head of personnel." It's a letter of resignation written by me. - Did you write it ? - Yes. - What does it mean ? - What you just read. It's a letter of resignation. Honey, you're an architect, a great architect. It's time you got serious about your career ! This is my plan: I'll take my exams, then we'll take a year off, we'll travel round Europe to see all the great works of art. You need to get your inspiration back ! - What do you think ? - That it's a great plan. A bit hard to put into action, though. Shit, who gives a damn ! We have our whole lives ahead ! Here's to life ! To life ! You've really never been with anyone since you separated ? At first I hoped Ilaria would return, that it was just a phase, and that we'd have put our dentures in the same glass. But then time went by, and I got used to being on my own. I wanted to focus on looking after my three daughters. - Be honest, you do it on purpose. - Do what ? You know perfectly well ! A man who's so dedicated to his girls is irresistible to women. You think so ? I assure you. - Well, when we get talking... - Time flies, I know. Well... I should go. - I live here. - Nice. - What's the plan ? - The plan ? No, I mean... What's the plan ? I'd love to let you have your way right now but my therapist says you're nearly all bastards, so I'll wait till next time, if you don't mind. I don't mind. Well, what else can I say... Till next time. - Can I have my dad's office keys ? - No. - Please ! - Why ? - I have to get something, he knows. - Darling ! - Honey ! Why didn't you tell me you're seeing my father ? - Sorry ? - You know what I'm talking about. I couldn't tell you, it's confidential. - For him, not for you. - I didn't think it was appropriate. It's a delicate matter. You're in therapy to try and save your marriage but you don't tell me ? Don't shout. I don't want to save it, it's over. You know that ! - So why are you in therapy then ? - To fully accept that it's over between us. I'm trying to end it, it's not easy. - Are you really trying to end it ? - Of course. Honey ! Hi. I came to thank you for the Paris trip, but I picked the wrong time, What ? You said you were taking me ! - Her ? She's 20 years old ! - You said you were trying to end it. You told her you were trying to end it ? - I can... - You're sick. And I'm 18, actually. Shut up. Just shut up. Now I know why you've been so nice recently. - That's not why. - Please ! Aren't you ashamed ? She may be 18, but she's right about one thing. You really are sick. There's 20% off all sofas, grab a bargain. You knew he meant a lot to me ! - I knew he wasn't right for you. - Why try to save his marriage ? That's my job. Is it your job to ruin your daughter's life too ? What's up ? Luca, he's invited me to his house. Fabio's invited me to his house too. - I'm a bit nervous. - Me too. I'm meeting him after work. Can we focus on me ? I've never been with a man, tell me how to do it. We've joked until now, but now I'm going to Luca's house, I'm in the shit ! Just let him do everything, you can't go wrong. The light, shall I ask him to turn it off ? I don't know, some people like to keep it on. You're no good, you're no help whatsoever ! Tell me about your first time, so it'll be less embarrassing. No way ! I'll tell you what I do with women and you tell me if that's okay. All right. To start, I put on some music. He'll do that, you're going to his house. I take her hand and accompany her to the bedroom. Or do straight people start on the sofa ? We skip that... It depends. Just see where he takes you. Then I look into her eyes with desire - and I start undressing her. - No, you wait for him to do that. Perfect. Then I lay her gently down on the bed and I start caressing her everywhere, on her nose, eyes, mouth, neck... and I touch her nipples. Spare me the details ! Forget about all that and let him make the first move. Shit, can't I do anything ? Making love to a man's a real drag ! You can invert your roles later, but at first it's best the man leads the way. - Why ? - I don't know ! They're the men and we're the women. Women are passive, where's the fun ? Sorry... could you turn the light off ? ?You want to know what I felt seeing it for real ?? ?I found it funny.? ?That thing hanging between his legs looked absurd ! ? ?Right, now it's no longer hanging.? ?It's not so funny now, more aggressive, I'd say.? ?Yes, most definitely.? Very aggressive ! ?And now what do I do with this thing ?? - Want to use something ? - No, I'll have a drink later. No, I mean as a contraceptive. No, nothing. Hi ! - How are you ? - Fine. Excuse me. What is it ? What's the matter ? Tell me what's wrong. Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Okay, let's go. I... I'm going. Enough ! - This is my voice. - Please, stop it. Happy now ? Open up, please ! - Alessandro? - She's gone. - What do you mean ? - She's gone, she's not here. - Have you tried to... - She won't answer her phone. No one's heard from her, she's left the dog here, she'd never do that. I'm very worried. Let's report her missing. - I'll come with you. - I'll pick you up. - I'm coming with you. - There's no need. There is, I think you've both caused enough trouble already. When did you last hear from her ? Over 1 2 hours ago. I think it's a bit soon to declare her missing. We're talking about someone who's never gone away, - ..she's never left the dog... - I love you. - Yes, I love you. Knowing her, something has happened, trust me. Or I wouldn't be here. All right. - Do you have a photo of her ? - Sorry ? - A photo of her. - Not with me, no. - Give me a description then. - Okay. - Height ? - About 1.70 m. - Maybe a bit more. - Yes, a bit more. - So, 1.72m ? - Yes. - Hair ? - Fair. - Can you be more precise ? - Quite fair. Let's say, honey blonde. With lighter strands around the neck area. She often wears it up, but sometimes she wears it down. Over her shoulders, yes. Eyes ? - Green, is that enough ? - Light green... with hints of blue. And small specks of amber, which are especially visible in daylight... Who should I be speaking to ? Has dad ever spoken to you about Alessandro's wife ? I'm bloody furious with dad, but this doesn't make sense. Will you help me or should I keep thinking that my dad's a bastard ? Well ? Alessandro's wife and the lady with the dog are the same person. What ? Yes. And believe me, getting her back with her husband cost him a great deal. Do you realise ? If I hadn't ordered a juice, I'd never have met you. Juice or no juice, I'd have found you all the same. This afternoon my cousin is coming from Turin, for one night. - Do you mind ? - No, not at all. - She's fun. - Is she ? Hi. Hi. Bless you ! - You must be Sara. - And you must be Barbara. Come in. - Luca's still at the office. - Forgive me for intruding ! What a cool house ! I'm flying to Prague tomorrow, - I'm sorry to burst in like this. - Nonsense ! Plus, you're family... Actually, we're second cousins, we've not see each other since we were 10. Baia Felice Campsite, in Terracina ! A luxury resort ! - Shall I make some coffee ? - I'll make some. - What a cute girlfriend my cousin has. - Thanks. - I remember him being a loser. - No way ! - We were 10... - He's gorgeous now. - You're defending him... - Lucky you, being so in love. - Aren't you ? No, never again. ?I'm here to tell you something, it's about you and me.? ?Words should bring us together...? ?but if that's not the case, we can do without them.? ?I can stop speaking.? ?Or I can learn your language.? ?But regardless of sounds, silences...? ?and noise.? ?And regardless of any form of communication...? ?I want you.? I was such an idiot, I hadn't realised. - What a bastard ! - You see ? But, you know how long it took me to end it ? 10 minutes, honestly ! I left before he could even think of inventing an excuse. And you know what the funny thing is ? That I'm happy ! - And I've reached a decision. - What ? I want to have a relationship with a woman. I've given it a lot of thought. Being with a woman must be fantastic, I really want to try. Look at us two, for example, we've only just met and already we're in harmony. That would never happen with a man. I think... things are much better between two women. Think about it. - Believe me, it's not like that. - What do you know ? I know because sexuality is an important thing, - you can't decide in haste. - It's not a hasty decision. - It's not ? - I can feel it in my belly. - Not your belly... - All in my belly ! Maybe you've been unlucky, not all men are bastards. Luca is an incredible man. He's caring, attentive and gentle. He's restored my faith in men. - What are you doing ? - Can I take a shower ? Everything you need is upstairs, hot water, cold water and soft water. - How long have you been together ? - Not long. Three days. - Only three days ? - And a half. Come on ! We'll talk about it again in two years' time ! Anyway, I bet sex with a woman is fantastic. Our bodies are so much nicer, more appealing, smoother. - Don't you agree ? - Yes ! I want to try it. I'm so disappointed with men It might not be forever, I'll try, I'll experiment, to understand... - Can I use a towel ? - Upstairs. There's no soap, can you bring some ? Luca, sorry, something came up... It's nothing serious, just a family matter. I'm really sorry I can't be with you tonight ! But your cousin's here, take her for a walk, or out to dinner... Yes, her flight's in the morning, I'll be back tomorrow. If I don't see her, say goodbye for me. "Tonight: Row M, seat 1 " Luca, I'm back. ?Sara, you were right, not all men are bastards.? ?Luca is a fantastic guy, he's caring and sensitive.? ?Sorry, I hope you'll be able to forgive me.? ?Sara, we didn't plan this, honestly.? ?It took us by surprise too.? ?We've gone away together and we'll be back next week.? ?Sorry, sorry, sorry.? ?You're a fantastic woman.? ?You can leave the keys with the concierge.? I'm a fantastic woman. Hi. - Where did you get to ? - Can I come in ? Of course. Alessandro was cheating on me, and you knew. You should sit down next to me, right ? You know, being cheated on isn't what hurts. It's the humiliation, of having to say certain things... And having to ask all those questions. Why ? When ? When did you see each other ? For heaven's sake... I'd rather die, you know. But I have absolutely no desire to die. So you know what I did ? I committed suicide. Just for a few seconds. One jump and off you go. Your whole life flashes before your eyes and you fall down, down, down... all the way to the bottom. But then you get up again, and you go up, up, up, all the way up to the top... and then it's fantastic, because you've left everything behind you. And you're ready to start all over again. Ready to start over, maybe from the couch of his dear childhood friend. I'm not a childhood friend of his, I'm his therapist. - He was in therapy ? - Yes. And he found out many very important things. But the most important one was that he still loves his wife. - What did he tell you ? - Where would you like me to start ? From the beginning. I'll start from Zia Teresa's in Maccarese then. ?Okay, I've finished.? ?I don't feel any better, but how could I have known ?? ?It's only by doing it that I realised it wouldn't help.? ?Now there's just one thing left for me to do.? ?You are my heart's delight,? ?And where you are, I long to be? ?And where you are, I long to be? ?You make my darkness bright,? ?When like a star you shine on me? ?Shine, then, my whole life through? ?Your life divine bids me hope anew? ?That dreams of mine may at last come true?
