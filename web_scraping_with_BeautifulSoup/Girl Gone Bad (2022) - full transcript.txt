Weed Dad, it means weed. Ah, well when I was your age, we just called it pot. So you did it at my age. Is that permission? No ganja. Are you all packed for your trip? [Ron sighs] I think so. Make sure I got everything. [Ron scoffs] What the f- [papers rustling] Where in the hell did you get this? Cousin Chris got it from school so I took it from his bedroom last time we were in Utah. Well you do realize that it doesn't exactly work the same way once you already have a kid. I don't care, I just don't want another sibling. Whoa. What do you honestly think is gonna go on this weekend? Sex. Lots of sex. [Ron scoffs] You know, adult friends can go out for a weekend and still just be friends. Right. Especially when they're all single in the middle of nowhere with no cell reception and I'm assuming there's a bar. It's BYOB. [papers rustling] That's a wrap. [Ron scoffs] [papers rustling] I need you to be safe for me this weekend, okay? Dad, I can manage myself. Yes. I know you're 16 and I trust you, but nobody else and even if you can manage, just... [melancholic music] I just need you to be safe for me this weekend little Bean drop. Dad. [ominous music] I'll be completely fine, okay? Just have fun. I'll follow your rules and I'll see you on Monday. Yeah. I better get going. [Ron laughs and sniffles] [Ron sighs] If I stay any longer, might as well just stay the night. Go in the morning.

Who the fuck are you? Fine, fine. [Lester breathes heavily] Are you seriously asking me to do this again? You listen bitch. You seriously think you can scare me? You're gonna put on this big show when I goddamn know you're not gonna- -[Lester groans] -[electricity buzzes] Talk! I get it. You're fucking nuts. Talk! I don't know anything about your friend. I'm just here at random. You better start telling the truth or it's gonna get a lot worse around here. [Lester chuckles] Just try me. You seriously think I can't take what a 16 year old can dish? I already know you have. I serve. I've survived worse than you can imagine. You're military? Serve and protect. I'm a cop darling. Okay. You're not going anywhere. I'm going upstairs and I will call- The police? [clamps clank] [door opens] [soft ambient music] [soft ambient music] [ominous music] [door opens, closes] It's a bit of a step backwards from car batteries, don't you think? You know when they trained for interrogation. [Lester grunts] [pan clinks] Fuck! Do not scream in here for Christ's sake. [Lester grunts] So you're a cop, yeah? Bad idea to tell me you pig piece of shit. [pan clinks] [Lester grunts] For Christ's sake. Listen, this can be very easy. Very, very easy. As long as you follow some simple directions from me. Got it? Before you think that anything is working in your favor tonight, one call to the police is all this will take. Yeah. You are in over your head. Really doesn't matter if you trust me about being a cop or not. At this point it's your best interest to release me. You can walk away and live your normal life because I'll make sure that nothing happens to you at the end of this, okay? You're 16. Do you really wanna spend the rest of your life in prison for killing a cop no less? [Lester spits and breathes heavily] I suggest you release me. [train rattles] You sure you wanna be here with me? Yeah, I'm sure. [phone beeps] What's wrong? It's nothing. What was that on the phone? It's just Lexi again. Lexi. She's such a bitch. -She's a complete slut. -Sammy, stop. That's your friend. I can handle my problems by myself. You don't need to try to be something you're not. -Well yeah, but- -No buts. I'm here for you, not to make you hate your friend. [train rattles] I suggest let me out. No. [Lester groans] Let's see. Let's see. [Samantha rummages in pockets] You're actually a cop. You piece of shit. All right. Lester Holbrook, officer Lester Holbrook. You are so stupid. What do you know? Who breaks into two homes in one night? Kills one person, tries to kill another and carries their police and ID badge with them? [Samantha scoffs] You have to be an idiot for that. But now it's not the time to talk about that. I'm gonna give you a chance to talk. Piss me off once and it's over. No. -[squishing sounds] -[Lester groans] I'm not asking. I'm only waiting. Amanda. [Lester gasps] What a lazy ass name. [dramatic music] Now Armenia? Ah, Armenia. That's exotic. That's hot. Imagine you're feeling hot. Just whew, horny as shit. Then this smoke show, this real sweet piece starts to show you some interest. A guy like me? Mh, oh yeah. So you start talking and talking and you send some more dirty shit, then the dirty shit starts to get real. Requests are being made, they're being followed. All is well. Then come the extra requests. You need money for this, drugs for that. Who cares? But it's time for my benefit. So I told her all of this can happen, but if we're getting real like that, oh we're getting real all around. Daddy wants some action. And then some hen from the hen house comes around and stops mama hen from catering the cock and shit is not so smooth in our arrangement anymore. So she tells me she lied to me about her age and that she's a teenager. That she's gonna out me to the police if I talk to her again. Well, why should I believe her now? I have seen too many cases like this. I know how this whole ordeal ends. It ends with somebody's life getting ruined and it was not gonna be the officer of the law. I have done more in my career than she was ever gonna accomplish. She was an artist. Oh, you mean those fucking doodles. You killed a talented artist. I only have one regret. I only wish I could have killed her little dyke girlfriend first! Open your ears Les and listen to me. Listen. There is a very limited chance that you're gonna make it out of here. You don't know what you walked into. I hope it was worth it you piece of shit. You think you walked into the hen house? [Samantha scoffs] Look around. Do you feel like the fox? [Lester groans] We have a long night ahead of us. And you can bet your pedo-dick that you'll find yourself right. You should have killed me first. Now look into my eyes and go cluck. Little chicken shit. [Samantha scoffs] [train rattles] Cheers. Hey, why no excitement? This is our first time being able to do this. Your dad and my mom won't be back until tomorrow. It's not that, I was just hoping it would be us two. You know, we didn't have to get stoned and I really don't need this cooler. Come on, it's summer. Go big or go home. Samantha, I've already told you, you don't need to try so hard for me. What if this is just me? Your friends aren't here, you can let your guard down. [dog barks in distance] [birds chirp in distance] [train rattles] [drawer opens, closes] [Samantha breathes heavily] [Samantha sobs] [Samantha breathes heavily] [paper rustling] [Samantha sobs] [paper rustling] [knife clinks] [bag unzips] So the first thing I wanted to say was, sorry about the leg. Just the leg? You're lucky it was even the leg. That said, I'm not as heartless as some, I'm gonna go ahead and clean it for you. Look. See? Not even sharp. [Lester grunts] -Ow! -Relax. [Lester screams] I just have to keep the wound fresh for this to work. Hey, hey! [Lester screams] Jesus Christ kid. I'm not a kid, I'm 16. -[Lester pants] -Just for that? Oh, oh, fuck. [Lester grunts] [ominous music] Oh, relax, it's sanitary. [Lester grunts] [Lester screams] [knock on door] [Lester cries] Oh shit, right. Pizza. Don't you make a sound. [Lester grunts] [door opens] Hey, so that's two large Hawaiian, comes to $24.85. Wait, don't I know you? Yeah, you went to my school. Couple of grades older. Yeah, nice. Go Highlanders! Haha! So you are not at that party on Prenter tonight? No, I heard it was kind of a shit show. So, i'm having a bit of a thing of my own. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I heard some sounds. Thought you might be having a party. [Weakly giggles] Oh, oh, strange, yeah. You know, I get off in a couple of hours. I could grab some stuff, come by later for the party. You know? I could bring my unique blend of grass-fed, hormone free, certified organic Blairness. It's my unique brand of super awesome brand. Like the Blair Witch Project. That's not a brand. Nope. Uh... Oh wait! I could be this party's fresh of breath Blair. I mean breath of fresh Blair. My name's Blair by the way. I didn't catch your name. Must have only said it once. Hmph. [sarcastic chuckle] [door closes] [Samantha sighs] Still got it. Yeah! [door opens, closes] I have good news! You get a bit of a break. I just had two pizzas delivered. And since you killed my date, I have to eat them alone. -[Lester growls] -[loud slap] I'm really starting to hate your restlessness. What are we going to do? [Samantha chuckles] Got it. I don't want my pizza to get cold, so we'll make this quick. [Lester grunts] -[pizza squelches] -♪ Just a little piece of pie ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take one bite and throw the rest away ♪ ♪ No pie for you ♪ ♪ And then other people ♪ ♪ They'll just eat the entire pie for themselves ♪ ♪ Without leaving ♪ [door opens] [melancholic music] [Samantha sniffles] [ominous music] -[Samantha sniffles] -[laptop slams shut] [door opens, closes] -[Lester mumbles] -[water splatters] You have a choice to make. I can call the police and your entire life can be ruined. [Lester spits] -And what else? -Nothing else. That's it. That won't work the way you think. You have no evidence. [Lester breathes heavily] Also by definition, that's not a choice. I have evidence. I have you. Yeah. You have a cop in a hostage scenario. That's it. This is just gonna make life worse for you and your parents. Parent. Who cares? I bring it back to your best choice being letting me out. [Lester breathes heavily] No. No, that would be the biggest mistake. You're right, I have a cop in a hostage situation and at this point I've already committed to anything that could get me into serious trouble. This doesn't leave any other option, really. I'm all in. So, here's the thing. Tonight was supposed to be kind of a first time type of thing for me. And well, I figure since you took away one first time for me tonight, you can pay me back in another. -So that's why. -[phone vibrates] Shit. Shit. Shit! Fuck! [Lester groans] -[phone vibrates] -[door opens, closes] [phone beeps] Hi Angel, how's the night going? Going well, boring. What's going on? Are you okay? I thought that there was no reception. [Jillian] There isn't. I'm not up there yet. I haven't heard from Ron still. Maybe I should go over there. How far are you? [Jillian] At least halfway. No, way too far to backtrack. Um... Just keep going or find a hotel. I don't want you to be unsafe. [Jillian] Okay, my angel. I'll try making it there. Love you. Love you too. Hold on, you are supposed to be at a movie. Uh... [Jillian] Don't lie to me, Samantha. I already came back from the movies, it wasn't long. [Jillian] Sorry, I'm just being a mom. Have a good night. [phone beeps] [Samantha sighs deeply] [Samantha deeply exhales] [door opens, closes] [tense music] You're so ugly. [camera flashes] You're a fucking monster. [camera flashes] You don't deserve beauty. [camera flashes] [camera flashes] You don't deserve happiness. [camera flashes] [tense ambient music] [camera flashes] [camera flashes] [train rattles] [ominous music] I know what you're thinking. 16 year old girl down on her knees for me. One more and I got a turkey. What are you doing? Wait, what are you doing? Shh... None of this will be made any easier with all your whining. Now we had a little interference on the way, but I took care of that so now we have all night. Don't worry, it would be pointless for me to kill you. At least not until I've had my fun. [manically laughs] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! Have you thought this through? You can't go digging out people's eyes. You fucking crazy bitch! You're right. You're right! I really am just jumping into this thing. One sec. [door opens, closes] [door opens, closes] [dramatic music] [pills rattle] -Swallow. -[Lester gags] Swallow! [Samantha sighs] Fine! [Lester coughs] Bring your mouth, there. [manically laughs] [water splatters] I already told you, none of this will be made easier by your whining! That was your only chance at any sort of pain reduction. Won't people hear me scream? [manically laughs] Around here? If they're not drunk or drugged out they're already passed out on their sleeping pill. I'm not concerned. [Lester grunts] [Lester screams] [water running] So stupid. You're so fucking stupid. Stupid, ugly shit. [Samantha breathes heavily] [Lester groans] [chair scoots] [Lester breathes heavily] [Samantha pants] [chair scoots] [Samantha pants] [train rattles] No, no, you're not Sammy. You are not ugly. You're absolutely beautiful. You're just being nice. No, I'm not. I know how other people wanna see you. I know that with school starting next week this probably won't be a thing anymore. What do you mean? I mean, you're gonna go back to hanging out with Lexi and everyone else. I'll be back to hanging in the library at lunch. It's just how it's gonna be. I know you care about me, but I know what is most important right now. I don't want anything to stop. None of it. What are you saying? Labor Day weekend. Our parents are going on their like high school reunion cabin thing. They're so going for sex. Yeah, they are but what if we planned a little visit to my place? What do you have in mind? Whatever we can think of before the school year starts. [Amanda laughs] Sounds great. [train rattles] You're so fucking stupid. Stupid, ugly shit! [Samantha pants] [chair scoots] [Lester groans] [Lester groans] [chair scoots] [chair scoots] [chair scoots] [ominous music] [Lester breathes heavily] [Lester groans] [tense music] [tense music] What the fuck do you think this is? [chair drags] You don't think I have this shit figured out? You think I'm a fucking idiot? You're out of your goddamn mind kid! Don't call me kid! [Lester screams] You can't roll a joint. Yes I can. I'm better than any of my friends. Then your friends can't roll a joint. Fuck you. What are you, the weed police? [Lester chuckles] Kind of. Go shoot a black kid, you pig. [Lester groans] That's quite a tongue on you. Wouldn't you like to know? I roll better joints than any of my friends, so whatever. Don't. Don't do that. Don't do what? You're doing that thing that kids your age do. What did I say about calling me kid? Fine. A mature young woman with homework and a bedtime. You can't just take a percentage of the people that you know and use that as a basis of fact. It's like saying you're the best driver you know. Everyone's the best driver they know according to themselves. [Lester scoffs] The truth is, everyone sucks at it. Slow down Professor. When did the playground pervert become so nuanced? Nuance nothing. You're 16. You're still learning. Just look at the situation we're in right now. [Lester scoffs] Here's the thing, and it's something you haven't considered Do you have a plan? What do you mean? [Lester scoffs] A plan? It's the type of thing that happens when someone has two brain cells to rope together before creating a hostage scenario. Excuse me, you killed Amanda, not me. And? That doesn't change anything about this. All anybody needs to see is that I'm tied up and I have wounds all over and, um, yeah, I'm missing a fucking eye. [Lester chuckles] That's all anybody needs. What I did? It'll be punished eventually. [Lester breathes heavily] Doesn't mean you're gonna get away with any of this. [Lester breathes heavily] And oh, you can bat your eyes and you can play the jail-bait card all you want and you'll still be the girl who tortured a cop, [Lester breathes heavily] and that's all they'll need to make an example out of you. [Lester breathes heavily] That will fall apart so easily. [Lester breathes heavily] Just look how much you're losing just talking to me. [loud clash] It's 'cause you're not letting me smoke it. And you just keep talking my ear off like you think I give a shit! Well, guess what? I don't. I don't give a shit, so shut up! Yeah. Yeah, this is clearly not affecting you. Look, if you just take a moment and listen to me, I can help. Shut the hell up. You don't know anything. If you think you're so fucking smart, Hmph. [Lester breathes heavily] [Samantha chuckles] [Samantha sighs] You know what? This isn't working for me. I think you need something a little less talkative and a little more creative. [Lester groans] [pan clinks] [tense music] So here's the deal. I can't keep being here with you, so I need a fail safe. [Lester groans] [Samantha chuckles] Hang tight. [Samantha chuckles] It's just far enough from the stool that if you try to jump, you'll end up hanging yourself. So I don't wanna hear a peep. It'll be hard anyway. Honestly, this whole ordeal is just starting to bore me. [door opens, closes] [soft thud] [Samantha breathes heavily] You are not ugly. You are beautiful. You deserve your beauty. You deserve happiness. [Samantha breathes heavily] You are not ugly. You are beautiful. You deserve your beauty. You deserve happiness.

Let me in unless you want me to die out here. Let me in! Okay, okay, fine. -Come on. -You are my best friend. Unlike Holly Morton. You know that bitch slept with Mike. Shh!

[Lester grunts] [body thuds] [Samantha pants] [water running] Okay, let's get you over to the couch. No, I'm fine. I like it in there. Shh... [loud thud] Ooh, I met the cutest guy at the party. Party! [Lexi groans] A little nerdy, but like, cute. Just go to sleep. [Lester groans] [ax dragging] [knock on door] [door opens] You get five seconds to tell me what the hell you're doing in my backyard at this hour. Well, I met Lexi earlier tonight and she said to meet her here. What? You don't seem drunk or anything. [Blair scoffs] Oh no, I don't drink and drive. I went directly to the party after work. Oh, there was a guy here earlier. Is he still around? No. No, he isn't. And wait, why are you even asking that? Uhh... I guess it's out of line. I don't know. May I come inside? Now is not really a good time. Oh, maybe I can just wait inside until Lexi's ready? Yeah, it's gonna be a while yet. Oh, well it's just that I said I would drive her home. Oh, come on in. [door closes] Just sit right there. And the moment that you think you can take her home, please do. Promise me that you're actually taking her home. Oh, no, no. Don't worry. I'll take her right home. Okay. I just- I have other things to take care of at the moment, so. Understood. I don't think you're a rapist. [tense music] Get out. Get her out. Both of you go! Out now! And Lexi, take Lexi too. I gotta open my car door and then clear the backseat. It'll take some time. Go! [dramatic music] [Lester groans] [tense music] Fuck off! Please leave me alone! [Lester screams] Shut your face, you incel. You killed her. [Lester gags] You killed the only one that ever got me, [Lester gags] the love of my fucking life! She was just a kid, you sick piece of shit! You don't get it. [Lester gags] I was trapped. [Lester gags and coughs] There was no other choice. [Lester cries] It would've ruined me. She would've ruined me. I'm not a killer. I'm not. I'm just somebody who was trapped. I made a bad choice. You're not the victim here, asshole. She was 16 years old and you took her from me. [Lester coughs] And you won't meet her where you're going. [Lester grunts] [eerie music] [ax clinks] I'll leave. I'll leave right now and I won't tell anyone anything. You'll tell everyone. I know you Lexi. I know how you work. You made her life a living hell. Please. Please just leave me alone. You were the worst to her. I didn't mean to. Okay, I didn't mean to at all. Yeah? Then tell me who are we even talking about? That's what I thought. [Samantha groans] [dramatic music] [floor creaks] [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [body thuds] [tense ambient music] [Lexi breathes shakily] [phone vibrates] This won't work. I know you and something here won't work. You can't see things through and you've missed something. Think seriously, think. Please, just let me go. I won't tell anyone anything. Okay? [train rattles] [ax clanks] [water trickles] [gas burner clicks] [soft thud] [Jillian] Samantha. Sammy, where are you? I'm in my bedroom, mom. It's like 5:00 AM. So you think you got away with it? I know you went to a party tonight. You told me straight to my face that you were going to the movie and that I could trust you. [Samantha laughs] Hey, what are you smiling at? I'm not messing around. I also know that you were smoking pot. I told you, you can't do this until you're older. I'm sorry, mom. But, at this moment it's too late. I love you and I don't wanna disappoint you, but can we please just talk about this tomorrow? Okay. We'll talk tomorrow. Have a good night, Sammy. I love you. Wait, mom? I love you too. And if there's anything that you wanna talk to me about, you can. [Jillian sighs] Well thanks, hon. That means more than you think. Honestly, I'm a little bit worried right now. I haven't heard from Ron all night. I'm sure he is fine. Yeah, probably. Is there something going on between you and Ron? No. Nothing more than single friends helping each other not be single. And that means? Whatever you decide it means. I love you Samantha. Have a good sleep. [Samantha cries softly] To my love, Amanda, There is only so much in this world that I can offer you, now that you're not a part of it but I hope I offer you the solace to know that your memory has remained vindicated. I don't know how you got into the situation you were in with Les, or why you chose to never tell me about it. I just need to let you know, no matter the reason tonight you were done right and that's something. [Samantha sobs] [laptop shuts] Yeah, the school had the memorial today. Thank you mom. It's all just so new, you know? I'm just really missing her. No. No one knows but she was at a party that night. Mom, I told you I wasn't there. No, I told you, mom. I was just trying to make it seem like I was there. Yes, it matters if people think I was there. [Samantha sighs] I know, mom, you don't get it. I'm sorry for that. [Burner flickers] Oh, I didn't really know his daughter that well. Probably wouldn't be too good for me to come, honestly. Yeah, I'm happy I'm alive too. All right, mom. Try to have a good day at work. I'm here for you when you get home. [knock on door] Love you, mom. [knock on door] [door opens] Blair. Uhh... Are your parents home? No. Close the door. What the fuck? Close the door! [door closes] What are you here for? I didn't go to Lexi's memorial today, you know. All that anyone's ever said since last week was that I definitely killed her. Why would anyone think that? Because Samantha, I was the last one with her. Except I wasn't was I? Yeah, like some asshole, you left the moment you knew you weren't getting laid that night and you left the drunk girl by herself. Nice, way to pass the buck. Yeah, I told you I was going to drive her home. Had nothing to do with sex. Oh please, then why did you leave? Because you were making it so clear for me to leave, that's why. I said both of you. Yeah, sorry I was scared shitless and I ran. None of this matters. What happened after I left? She was already gone before I got back. Bullshit. I delivered a pizza here earlier and I heard screams. I figured it was just some kinky shit and then later on it was clearly something else. What happened? Don't yell in this house. [Samantha pours tea] Doesn't matter what happened after I was gone. There's a lot of people who cared about her who would disagree. And I'm not taking the fall for something I didn't do. Three people died that night, you know? And? That changes nothing. This whole last week, everybody has been talking about Lexi dying, talking about how great of a person she was, how nice she was to everyone. It's a crock of shit. She was a bully. There's someone she used to bully. She died at 16 years old. So anything else that someone could have been known for [chuckles sarcastically] Lexi couldn't have achieved any of it. Three other people died that night. Amanda, her dad, and Lexi. So tell me why is no one talking about them? Because they were both murdered in cold blood. But no one had a vigil. No one had paintings of them put up all over the fucking walls. No one had a word to say about them. And yet you come over here and berate me because someone you left has passed. And you, along with everyone else, is just gonna pretend that because she's dead means she was a good person. You said a lot of people cared about her and I'm sure you're right. That's exactly the problem. Because meanwhile, Amanda was there and she was kind, and thoughtful and artistic. [Samantha gags] And she was someone who deserves every bit of memoriam that Lexi is getting. But instead she just got bullied relentlessly called a loser, called a piece of shit by Lexi and everyone else. And somehow having the strength to show back up to school every day. So frankly, I don't give two shits about what punishment you endure. Amanda endured worse. You said three people died, then you said three other people. Who else did you kill? It'll be easier if you just tell me. I'll be going to the police regardless. This is a very bad idea for you. I recommend you delete that and leave. Go to hell. Right now there's not any evidence linking you to the crime. They'll investigate you, find nothing and move on. And even if there's a shred of anything credible recorded on there, I'm still the cute 16 year old girl and you're just creepy pizza guy who is currently in my home uninvited. This is recorded evidence. Okay. Okay, let's try it like this. Four people died last week and they're all in connection to me. Now let's say they investigate me and find nothing and they will find nothing. Do you want me to be the person against you when all this is said and done? You aren't in the right, you know. I hope you have your tracks covered for your own sake. You should leave Blair. Don't put yourself in a worse situation than you're already in. [door closes] [car door opens, closes] [car engine starts] [tense ambient music] Goddammit. Do need to cover my tracks. [tense ambient music] Hey Fiona, I just found you. [tense ambient music] In a very short amount of time, a reckoning is coming. Be it by law and order, or out on the streets. In one way or another, it's coming. I did something horrible last week. It wasn't Les, it was Lexi. I realized I've tolerated her abuse of you for too long. We didn't live in a world where I was able to see this, but I will make sure that everyone who ever made your life a pain will never be able to feel pain again. I love you Amanda. Rest well, I'm here for you. [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [dramatic music]
