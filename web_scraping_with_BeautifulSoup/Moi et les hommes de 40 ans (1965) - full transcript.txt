And these are the others, that's to say, men. They're to be found everywhere, everywhere, much like ants. I have nothing against men. The proof: I work in a hairdresser's... A hairdresser's for men, obviously. Ah, I love them, the poor dears! Their conversations are so varied, so interesting, so exciting. And then, they have so many things to teach us. Hello, sir. Have you ever been told how ravishing you are, little Caroline? Yes. In 1944, at the end of August, Liberation Day, they didn't care what they said. Pardon. Three days incognito on the Cote d'Azur, does it tempt you? Pardon. I have a lovely little house in the woods, near Gambais. Pardon. Don't you think that we would make a nice couple, eh? Pardon. A small trip to Japan... doesn't appeal to you? To get here, I catch the metro at Stalingrad, I change at Rome, and I go through Anvers, so... The uglier they are, the more they try to spoil you. We can't remain single. So, which one to choose? A boy that I like? I tried. Maxime. The first time I saw him, he took my breath away, with a great blow to the stomach. Like a boxer knocked to the deck. I remained on my feet, I don't know how. I was reeling. This, I understood, was serious. He was a student, but he never opened a book. He had an especially thick one that acted as the fourth foot on his bed. He called it "Dalloz". [Dalloz: French publisher of law books] He didn't pursue his studies seriously, all the time, he had to choose between the Penal Code and a stable bed. What he offered me was a Coke. And it was me who paid for it. 4.50F. Thank you. Are you done, are we going dancing? Why? Isn't it fine here? The one time you go out... You want a revenge match? - Okay. You said we'd go dancing. That's enough, back off a little! Is it yours, that white car out there? Yes, it's a Jaguar. It belongs to a buddy of my sister. What can she do? - My sister? - No, the engine! 180, 200. She could even reach 250. It doesn't purr like a Ferrari. You know, a 4.5L, it's twin-mounted fuel injection can turn 6,000 revs and not make a sound. All that, it doesn't top a Maserati. What are you doing? Do I tell you about shampooing? We have the right to an opinion. Yes, but only once we have a licence, not before. Buy me a whisky. You take me for an American, "4.50F, there, right away". I should just shut up, I suppose? And it doesn't bother you to make me wait around? Quick, an open lane! It was my fault, a Virgo should never get involved with a Taurus. I was wasting my time and my youth. I was going to change my approach. I've had enough of watching you bowl. Come with me. Come with me! - Fine, fine, okay. Decidedly! You know nothing about sport. I'm a girl, not a referee. You don't mind? We'll play our revenge match tomorrow. Come on, ciao. - Ciao. You're not mellowing, as you get older. What does that mean? You're so grumpy, it's like we were married. At least... Happily, there are compensations. The sooner we get back, the sooner we'll be in bed. Dream on! We were going to sleep together. Let's just say I don't want to sleep. - Well, exactly. Plus, you've done nothing to seduce me. But you're six months late, sweetie. We going to start over? Yes, exactly that. You don't even kiss me. You know I kiss better in a horizontal position. Standing, I get distracted. Yes, but I'm a woman, not an object. I have nerves and a soul, and this is true, even in a vertical position. And if you don't know it, leave me and go back to people of your own age. Sir, please. Your money. Tell me, what time do you finish? Around midnight. Here, Caroline. My ham! My fries! Remove your arm, you nearly had my jaw off. So, since that bowling incident, I see things clearly. Oh, but you could mind where you're going! What a nutjob! Good grief! What was I saying? It's over with Maxime. He treated me like a slave whom he did a little favour sometimes. And again, he was nothing exceptional. But he's a handsome bloke, Maxime. A dreamboat. I leave him to you, for one who has class, distinction and good manners. Not some rough soldier boy... - A dessert? No, never after the 25th of the month! You were saying? The good men are those who are not so clumsy. That's to say, those of 40 years. Look around you. Where to find them? In your salon. I only see their hands. Oh! Raise your eyes a bit. You'll see, it's worth it. You burned me. Pay a little attention. Shame on you. Excuse me. I'll fix that. Oh no, it's not serious, my dear. Its not an evil, but a pleasure. Sir, Caroline is incorruptible, the Robespierre of nail-polishing. But she never goes higher than the wrist. Charming. Here. What can I do to be forgiven? I don't know, how about... Dinner... Dinner with me, for example. Pity, he's not my type. Why not? I'll think about it. When, then? I don't know, one of these evenings. Gladly. If I may be so bold... Here, it's my card. Call me when you've decided. I'll phone you to fix an evening. So, see you soon. - See you soon. That's it, soon. See you soon. Hello. - Hello, master. Ah, master, are you a customer here? For close on 10 years. You didn't know? What a coincidence! The same address and the same hairdresser. It's a funny old world. Always on time. Manicure? Yes. I've booked Caroline. Caroline for Mr Casserti. Caroline for Mr Casserti! Caroline for Mr Casserti! Sure, sure! They take me for a radio-taxi. The Poiret case, at the assizes, is it progressing well? They've guillotined him. A tidy neck-line please. But the coverage we got! In "Match", "Le Figaro"... A success! He has a certain charm. So far, I've not seen better. Well, my dear, you seem somewhat pensive. You must clear your head. You look a little pale. It so happens, I have two seats for the opera this evening. I'd prefer the Cote d'Azur. Right now, they're playing 'La Traviata'. It's Italian. I love Italy. It's agreed, for this evening? Then, we meet at 8pm sharp. Take it, here's my card. 37, avenue Paul-Doumer. Is this the address of the opera house? No... it's mine. I would have liked to come and collect you, but I hadn't anticipated this unforeseen pleasure. I have many appointments... Don't wear yourself out. At 8pm sharp, I'll be there. What's he like, this Don Juan? Ah! A good forty, good situation, big lawyer, big apartment and a big car. Big heart? Certainly. In any case, a great talker. You'd think he lives in La Muette. I think this is a little too much. Try the black. Ah, very classy. Can I take any one I want? Yes. But don't spill any champagne on it. I know how to behave. This is not quite enough. It depends on what your knight is wearing. I know a guy who put on a dinner jacket to go to the opera. Really? He was conducting the music. Should I telephone him, my dear master? Fetch his business card from my bag next to you. Okay. He lives in avenue Paul-Doumer. Dial the number, my varnish isn't yet dry. Hello? Are you wearing a dinner jacket? Why? Who is speaking? Caroline, from Desfosse. - Caroline? Dear Caroline, it's nice of you to call me already. I don't know what to wear for this evening. This evening? I must be at yours in half an hour. At mine? Oh, but this is unexpected. You invited me, you're not going to let me down? Er... Me, let you down? Of course not! What are you wearing? Oh, well, I'm dressed very simply. Then I'll put on the turquoise with the scallops. Ciao. I'm on my way. The little scallops... The scallops... She's coming. She's coming! No, okay, okay. That too is okay. This is the emotion of it. It's not normal. She's coming. It's a success, your haircut. If that was all it took! But you see, I'm waiting for a visitor. A blonde visitor, if you know what I mean? You as well! But as I'm not used to it, I'm very worked up. You've never received a woman here? No, never... Yes, one. But I was married to her. Well, allow me to share some ancient wisdom. Are you planning a candlelit dinner? Yes. Then cut them in half, this way, 30 or 40 minutes later, the light dims, nature takes its course, and you've saved time. How kind of you! You are kind. Courage, old pal. There's not a moment to waste. I know, but it's the emotion. Have some. No, thank you. Excuse me. All the same. That's better. Ah, I forgot! After the opera, beware of the little candlelit dinner... It's the classic move. Look at that? Ouch! # The caviar. # # It's salty, to make you thirsty. # # The vodka. # # To be drunk like water. # Yuk! Can't have that. Red meat, she'll like that. Ah! It's not exactly HLM. [HLM: a type of French social housing] High-class, with marble like they were giving it away. My fortunes are picking up. A well-bred man waiting for me, a box at the opera... Maxime would grimace if he could see me! The lift! She's here! She's here! She's here. She's here. She's here. She's here, but... She's here. It wasn't mine, that one. Mine will arrive. Oh là là! You're not ready! We're going to be late. I'll keep it on, since we're going out. But no, you must take your time. No need to rush. There. You've been working all day. So have I, so there's no need to be rushing. But 'La Traviata'? - She can wait. She has nothing else to do. Also, you know, the opera... You like the opera? All those people screeching incomprehensible things... The gala show at the opera, is it a comedy? Well, you see, my dear... If I may call you that. It is just the two of us. There are galas and "galas". I've planned a gala that is pleasant, but impracticable for the theatre. Er... You'll see why. Here's the programme: caviar, foie gras, lobster, profiteroles with chocolate, pink champagne. What do you think? In your profession, wouldn't this be called breach of trust? I lied to you, I admit it. I don't have seats. And they aren't playing 'La Traviata'. It doesn't matter, if they're performing something else. Yes... This I doubt. I check their programmes... It's closed. - Ah! But no, don't make that face. Sit down, like this, there. That's better. Am I so scary? Ah yes! An unwanted tête-à-tête, it's like a meeting in the woods. But you know me. Not very much. And I'm not going into your bedroom to lie down. Have a drink, you'll feel better. I'll go find you some ice. It will warm you up. On your feet, I'm out of here. No, good heavens! I shouldn't have kidded myself, he's a Scorpio. Dear master, Caroline says hello. I'll remember this, lobster at 'La Traviata'. Caroline! Caroline! Ah, ah, ah, Caroline! Maybe she's in the bedroom... So soon? The lift! She's here. Ah! You're here. I was sure you'd come. My God! My God! You're so pretty. But you are somewhat over-dressed. But... - Come! Don't say anything. That telephone call moved me so much. Here, come in. Come in. Caroline! Ah, it's you! You haven't seen a delightful joker? I haven't seen a living soul. It's extraordinary. Imagine that... Tell me, Benechol. Do you take me for some sort of nitwit? Why? The miss was to spend the evening with me. There must be some misunderstanding. I was waiting for her. Nothing to concern you in there. Step aside. You're a little out of your league here. Well, disillusion yourself... My patience has its limits. My patience has its limits. This joke has gone far enough. Wait a moment, Caroline, I'm here. But what is it you want? Half each? I've had enough of this. And you had the nerve to ask my advice! You are violating my home. And you were trying to abuse this young girl. She'll spend the evening at my place. A thousand regrets, she's taken refuge here. The right of hospitality is sacred. I will not let her go back with you. You think I'm just going to give her up? Poor little thing... Stop, that's enough of that. Where do you think you are? Place Pigalle? Why don't you play 421 for me? I want you to get along, and immediately! I'd also like to have some choice in the matter. And I choose freedom. Good evening. Good heavens. - Well... Nice evening. What's Gigi going to say? I left my bag. At the lawyer's. It's salty, this stuff. How strong this is! Master, stay for dinner. A little champagne. - Willingly... I'm sorry, old boy. I was ridiculous. On my part, my words outstripped my thoughts. Don't go thinking... - Of course not. Here. Have you seen the candles? Just between us, dear friend, she's nothing to get worked up about. Did you see her chin? It's what they call crooked. I even thought that she had a squint. Oh yes, too true, too true. Let's face it, she's quite average-looking. And on the human level, what is she? An adventurer. A profiteer, like hundreds of others. Old boy, "hundreds"? Are you kidding? Thousands. In my opinion, we are dream prey for a girl of that sort. The bastards! Has your wife found accommodation in Cabourg? Yes, at the Grand Hotel. We go there every year. Mine is at Barbizon, with the children. Married and fathers of families! Ah, happy cuckolds! You'll see. Caroline, my girl, if you are for household peace, there's only one thing to do. Just you wait, my lambs. This deserves a good lesson. Hello, Gigi? Do what I ask and don't try to understand. Listen, in about 10 minutes, you're going to telephone... In the end, we should be grateful to her. Without her, we'd have continued to say "hello" and "goodbye", and nothing more. We wouldn't have got to know each other. I hope it's the start of a great friendship. To your deserving wife. - To your lovely kids. Ah, they're calling! Excuse me. You know, they're always taking me for the lawyer opposite... Oh, sorry! Caroline! This is difficult to say... I ask your forgiveness. Don't blame me. Men like you, you're too... you're too outstanding, I'm not used to it. I'm trying to learn, but I messed up. Do you hold it against me? - No, my dear. I can come back? - Of course! It's all forgotten now. And then I am very sorry that you quarrelled because of me. That's very nice of you. Come on, sit down there, like that, close to me. No, no! We are at my home. Exactly, you must satisfy all my desires. Go and get us a fresh bottle. No! - Oh, yes. Go, go, go. Remorse becomes you, my little Caroline. You are even prettier than before. While we're alone, Benechol... is married. No! - Yes. Oh! A man like him. Here we go! I'm not interrupting you? - Oh no. Here, take this. Hello, yes? Cabourg? Cabourg. Yes, himself, but what is it? The director of the Grand Hotel. My wife has left? A toothache? 23:34 to Saint-Lazare? And it's at 23:30 that you warn me? Thanks very much. Thanks. Right. My children, you can't stay here: my wife is coming. Then we must go to mine. Hey! Am I just some sort of decoration here? I would be delighted to meet Mme Benechol. I'm sure she's very nice. That's enough of that! Help me, go. We're going to mine. - No... Yes, okay. Let go of me! Sadists! Murderers! Hoodlums! Thugs! Sadists! Mummy! Murderers! Thugs that you are! Come. Hurry up and open it. Calm down, calm down. I want to wait for Mme Benechol. You take her shoulders, and I'll take her feet. We're going to mine. - No. Yes. Come on, hurry up. Come on. Go on. Look. There's not a minute to lose. There. Go on. Go, hurry, get in. This way, in the bedroom, on the bed. There. That's it. Next time, I'll send my wife to the Antilles. Oh, she's here! Okay. Fine. Enough for this evening. Champagne is not shampoo. There. One needs to proceed slowly. - What a humiliation! To be transported like an old piano... You aren't married, are you? What, me? Are you having a laugh? You swear to me? - May I die on the spot. You heard the explosion? This is getting serious. Go and alert the concierge. My dear, if you don't remove your dress, it will become all wrinkled. How curious! When a man wants a woman, he becomes scared of wrinkling her dress. Come on, come on, come on. Let me have a closer look at you. You're so pretty! You're too kind. I think I have a crooked chin. What idiot told you that? And I squint sometimes too. See. These are just notions. Come on. Yes? Who is this? The Esso station in Barbizon? I don't need any, I filled up yesterday, yes. Goodbye, madame. What? On the South Highway? My wife? She said she's on the way back? The little girl has measles? When did she pass through, madame? An hour and a half ago. My dear, get dressed, there's been a slight mishap. Nothing serious, I hope? - No, nothing serious, but... Then I can stay. Moreover, I'm going to take off my dress. No. You have to save yourself, and be quick about it. But my dress is crumpled. - You look fine. And my hair? - I'll call you a taxi. It will be the second time you've shown me the door this evening. First I get kissed, but now I get thrown out on the street. If you try to strong-arm me, I'll scream. Careful! Sorry. It's a case of force majeure. Help! Help! Help! What should we do? - This has been going on for an hour. Screams, then an explosion. Right. Step aside. Ring once at least, you never know. My wife. Yes, dear, I'm coming! You must go. Help! Go, get out. Allez hup! What's that? Murderer! Mummy! Oh yes, this way. It's just a bad moment that will pass. You want to let go of that? No! Shut up, I'm telling you. Shut up. Oh! Shut up. Mummy! What is it? Yes? Coming, dear. Yes, dear. Where is the girl? What girl? We all heard. We even saw you carry her in here. We heard a gunshot. What have you done? You burned her? - No. Then where is she? - Opposite. Of course! They're in this together. The two of them! - Men are all obsessed. You say the body's in there? "The body"? But then, it's already a corpse. He's delaying so his accomplice can scarper... Of course not! You stay with us. Take him, and let's go. Take him. Follow me. Follow me. But let go of me, at least! We are going to see if she's really here. My wife! She's here. I'm begging you, don't stay here. If she finds you, she'll kill me. You don't know her. On my knees, I'm asking you: leave, I'm begging you, leave. You play-act for everything! It's not funny. Go on, force the door. Oh! It's my wife. It's her. She's here! What is it? What have you done with the body? What body? They're crazy. Admit it, it'll make it easier. If you're looking for me, you've found me. I'm the violent sort! Wait, it's not okay to carry on like this. Here. - Don't try to run away! Don't touch me! I am a lawyer at the Court. At the Court or on the street, we don't care. There. Hold on, hold on. Hello, police? Hello, police? Calling Car 14. Car 14. Hello? Car 14. Car 14. Car 14, over. Go to avenue Paul-Doumer, number 37. Two sadists are killing a girl. Okay, we're on it. Step on it, hurry. I'll explain it all to you. It wasn't serious, we were having fun. I am very much alive. If you need us, don't hesitate. Thank you. Good night. So sorry. If I'd known my joke on the telephone... So the return of our wives, it was... It was a joke? That will teach you to say my chin is crooked. My regards to your wives. They must be very charming. No hard feelings. I don't blame you. I would have had less fun at the opera. Ciao! Yes, ciao. Oh! Oh! So, it was a false alarm? There was no injury? As you can see, I'm in one piece. That's the way we like it. Good night. Wait for me. You're not leaving empty-handed, I'm coming with you. Caroline, manicure for 12. Caroline, manicure for 12. 12, he can wait. Five customers this morning, it's a nightmare. La Lucette on rue de Ponthieu wouldn't do better. It's for Dr Oesterlin. I don't know him. Make an effort. He doesn't like waiting. You are nice, so I'll do it. I have to warn you, I only have time to refresh you a little. Oh, excuse me, it was worth the effort! Are you a surgeon? With hands like these... No. I'm as interesting to him as a lawn mower. May I? Put a little lotion on your hands, they're tending to chap. Thanks for the prescription. Hazel eyes, I particularly love them. Caroline, if you have anything about you, you won't let this one get away. Hello? I'd like to talk to Mme Oesterlin, please? There's no Mme Oesterlin? Perfect. I would like an appointment with the doctor, for an emergency. Come in. Well, come in. Please... Sit down. There. Your age, please. 20. Childhood illnesses? Whooping cough? Yes, doctor. Varicella? Yes, doctor. And measles as well. Anything else? Nothing serious? Good. Children? No, I'm not married. Perfect. So, what's wrong? Nothing, doctor. I feel dizzy, nauseated, I have nightmares. I even faint, occasionally. We've met somewhere before. Yes, this morning, at Desfosse. Ah, yes, yes, yes! How curious! Good. We need to take a closer look. Undress. Completely? Just the dress. Are you ready? Yes, doctor. And you? Lie down. Breathe. Not so hard. Lungs as good as new. Let's have a look at the heart. Oh, the heart... I sometimes feel like it's going to burst. It's a 20-year-old heart. Sit up. I have reflexes, eh! You have too much. Lie down. The liver. The liver does not exist. I have a liver that doesn't exist? The eye is clear. Good. You can get dressed. The diagnosis, now. A slight neurotonic imbalance... Intermittent spasmophilia... There may be enough to provoke some occasional trauma of the central nervous system. A tic? Leads a wild life. Whisky and girls galore, sexual exhaustion, liver full of bile, nervous overwork. You need a well-managed life, meals at regular hours. He needs affection, tenderness. A more supervised diet. I would even say overeat and put on a little weight. It wouldn't hurt him to lose a little. I'll make him tea and unsalted biscuits. There! A little nervous too. I will take away the coffee after dinner. Good. I'm going to give you a mild sedative, that's all. Thank you. And try to get some fresh air. We are all asphyxiated, in Paris. If I didn't spend my weekends in Deauville, I don't know how I'd survive. No, no, I won't hear of it. When do you want to see me again, doctor? - Never, I hope. "Never"! Okay? It's a shame. Goodbye, then. I'd prefer to say "adieu". Goodbye. Ah! Hello, everyone. Hello, Jacqueline. Hello, Pascal. In good form again? Hello, Victor. You'll give me a young person's haircut. The Beatles' haircut, would that look good on me? Barman! You do the lather, I'll rinse. Would you like a lemon press, as usual? An orange juice, and a double scotch. No, a scotch. And you, Caroline? Hey, Caroline! Would you care to join us? What will you have? A cognac. Ah, you, there's something not right. It's my heart. - Go and see a doctor. It's since I saw him, that it's not been right. It'll be all right! Me, even during tough times, I'm always cheerful. My recipe is fresh air. That's what you need. They've already told me. The cure would be a weekend in the country. Two days in Deauville, does that tempt you? Deauville? Deauville? Did you say Deauville? Listen, if you are agreed, we set off Saturday at dawn. And hup! Agreed, but on one condition: separate rooms, as friends. With me, no danger. Victor knows me. Isn't that right? We know you, Monsieur Bricaud. He knows me, Victor. I am in good form, I'm overflowing with sap, with vitality, with youthfulness. I'm 20 years old. When you telephoned yesterday, you reserved only one room. Two rooms. I remember perfectly, Albert: two rooms. Perhaps you made a mistake. It happens. But you said "one room, a large bed, I will not be alone." I said two rooms. At least go and see, it's so long since I was here. Ah yes, perhaps. At least... One minute, I'll go and check. It's foolish. Is it really a mistake? My profound apologies, we have found your reservation, it was indeed for two rooms. Unfortunately, the trainee in bookings communicated it poorly. Yes. Therefore, we retained only one room. Ah, you see? Give me another one. But, miss, the hotel is full. But where am I going to sleep? It's nothing, we'll sort it out. Friend to friend. Er... Porter! Take these suitcases to my room. Trust me, as friends. Here, Albert. - Thank you, doctor. Are you coming? Give me a moment, Bricaud. Wait for me here. Thank you, Albert. You had me worried. Doctor! Doctor! Hello, doctor. Caroline! What are you doing here, my dear? I'm here to take the fresh air. I already feel much better. Jean-Marc, are you coming? Yes, yes. I'm delighted, and I hope you have a good weekend. We'll see each other again? - Of course. Here, you bump into everyone. This evening, perhaps. This evening, definitely. For the room, the best... We'll discuss it later. Let's go swimming. You wouldn't think it, we're in Deauville. This is the way to catch a chill. Reaction! One, two! One, two! One, two! You'll see what you'll see. One, two! One, two! Hup! Forever young. You are irresistible. The fixed bar is my speciality. Watch closely. Hup! First exercise: a simple revolution using one knee. It's the beginning of the art. Hup! Hup! Bravo! Very good. - Wait, you've seen nothing yet. The big sun, and hup! The grand finale. Hup! A relaxed landing. Ouch! A couple of aspirins, and tomorrow, it'll be fine. Don't worry about me, I'll be back very late. What does that mean, "I'll be back very late"? That I will try to have fun, thinking of you. Of me? Yes. Because we only have one bed, when I return, you'll have to get up. To give me the spot. Good night! The great sun! Idiot! Did you have to be so dumb! Sir, where might I find Dr Oesterlin? He must be "au prive". "Au prive"? - In the casino, in the gaming room. Ah, au prive! Thank you. Show the miss to Dr Oesterlin. Oh! From the "grand siecle". [The age of Louis XIV] It's kind of busy, the decor, but it's stylish. It's not at all like a bowling alley. Where is the doctor? - He must be on the "chemin de fer". But he told me he was staying two days. Madame, chemin de fer... Yes, right... Here, this is it. Good, thank you. Thank you. Ah! Please, sir. Gentlemen, 120,000 "au banco". 120,000. Who says "banco"? Nobody at the table? Debout? Who says "banco"? Sorry. Banco is made, sir. Madame... Please, madame. Madame plays the hand. 9 à la ponte. "À la ponte"? 5 to the bank. Bravo, my compliments. Why? - Because you've won. Take it, it's yours. Oh no. By what right would I take your money? Take it, dear Caroline. It would make me happy. If you hadn't played my "banco", my money would have gone to a rich Englishman or a Council President to whom it wouldn't make a blind bit of difference. It's much better in your little handbag. I won because I said "banco"? And if I had lost? They would've taken 120,000F from you. 120,000F? Two months' work? Where do you want me to find that? You're truly adorable. You find? - Yes. Adorable. Here you are, Jean-Marc. This is your "try my luck"? May I introduce Caroline, a friend from Paris, Mme de Trevise, Valerie Delcaze. There, it's done. Do you play golf? I bet that she rides horses. I prefer le chemin de fer. As for horse riding, it's my favourite sport. And what do you do in Paris? - I... Caroline is a beautician. Ah! Good. We'll leave you. The consultation can become a tête-à-tête. Are you really on your own here? Yes. I am at the Normandy. How can it be that a pretty girl like you goes away alone for the weekend? You never know... I could always meet someone. Unexpectedly? Or by premeditation. Caroline! I've been looking all over for you for an hour. Thanks to your care, I feel better. Two hours' sleep in my room... Sorry, "in our room", and hup, I was good to go! Like I've been resurrected, I've arisen. Barman! Barman! Barman! A double scotch. Excuse me, I'm going to bed. Are you angry? No, but it doesn't do to lie to your doctor. You said you were alone. It's the truth. Don't be fooled by appearances. I sleep alone. I'm not like you. But I'm sleeping alone too. Really? But then everything can work out. Come in. In war, we must make do. Thank you for allowing me to give you hospitality. I requested two rooms, they only gave me one. It's not unusual, they're jam-packed. I hope I don't disturb you too much. But we couldn't let that little girl sleep on the beach. After all, gallantry is a man's privilege. So, I've left her room and come to sleep here. It's just for one night, and just as friends. I don't sleep badly, and I snore very little. A little abrupt, obviously, but that's the way I am. I'm sorry, no. This will never do. I need to open the window, otherwise I can't sleep. I'm sporty. Oxygen! I love oxygen... but not drafts. Excuse me, I have to remove the bolster. I sleep on one pillow. It's a sickness, but that's how it is. It's excellent for the spine. Besides, you're a doctor, you must know this. Good night. I'm falling asleep. The day I've had... Ah no. That, no. This is impossible. It wouldn't bother you to put out the light? Hey! It wouldn't bother you to put out the light? The light! Er, yes. Budge over a bit. Excuse me, I didn't mean to. And he's creeping over, and he's creeping over! Shamelessly! Good morning, monsieur. Here. I suppose that the coffee is for monsieur and the tea for madame. What's this look? Something wrong with my face? What's up? Bon appetit, ladies and gentlemen. Hello? Ah, it's you! Did I sleep well? Very well, thank you. Oh, are you angry? What can I do to be forgiven? My day belongs to you. Right. Okay. But without your friend. Of course. But with give-and-take: no Valerie. Just us two? Whatever you want, you decide the programme. Hold the butt in the hollow of your shoulder, check your line of fire, you raise, you lower... Photo? You agree? - Yes. Thanks. For tomorrow. - Thank you. It's funny. - What? This feeling of being on holiday. It's unpleasant? - Not at all, quite the opposite. It's good, to be able to leave it all behind somewhat. I like to forget myself, from time to time. If you could forget everything, would you like to? Okay. We'll quit it all and go. - Where? The end of the world, would that tempt you? Oh yes. The islands of the Orient, the Tropics, the Marquesas... My head is dizzy. - It must be sea-sickness. I feel like I'm on the way to leaving the earth. You're sure she didn't come back last night? No. And I've been here since 10pm yesterday evening. And the doctor? - Him neither. Ah, I see. It's a concern? - No, it's a shame. Nicolas! Hello. I was starting to worry. We're leaving. Pack your bags. Then come and help me. Come on, come with me. The fresh air has worn me out. Come on, come, Nicolas. Be nice. It went well? - Divinely. You're in love? - Like a fool. That annoys me, you know. - Ah, ah! No, no, not because of that, but because I'm a real friend. I don't want you to get hurt. Hurt? But look at me. Is that how I seem? Not right now, but in an hour, this evening, tomorrow, in two days perhaps. Trust in the experience of a womaniser. Men like Oesterlin, I know them. Charming, yes, in the evening between midnight and 2am, and you surrender. But you each live on different planets. He will not let you onto his and he will never come onto yours. What are you trying to say? Are you seeing him again? Soon, at Ciro's. Ah, I can imagine that! You will find it stuffy. "Adieu. We passed some delicious moments. We must have dinner one evening in Paris, just the two of us." You telephone, and then bye-bye. I don't believe that. Between my tweezers and my Rimmel, I've more than one trick in my bag. To mount a good defence, you must go on the attack, so I'm putting myself in the front line. She didn't understand at all. I will treasure the wonderful memory of this weekend, Caroline. Moments like these are unique, indelible. Sadly... - Sadly? Sadly, things don't always work out in life. You must understand... Listen, Jean-Marc, diplomacy isn't my forte. All my flights of fancy, I've forgotten them. My little head is not vast enough for memories. Meaning? Meaning... we live on two different planets, and I have no reasons to venture onto yours. So we won't see each other again? Oh yes. It's a small world. We will telephone. I'm a little surprised. Surprised? Then you don't know the girls of today. Tell me, do you have these sorts of flights of fancy often? Every week. My motto is: a port every Sunday, and a man in every port. In that case, there's really nothing more to be said. Yesterday's photo, if you want to go and look for it. So? Was it painful? Very hard. All the bad things I said to him upset me. I have to shake it off, before I change my mind. What can I do for you? Oh, the little cars! I've been thinking of them since we got here. Ah, the little cars. The little cars. Caroline, bye-bye! Catch me if you can. Help! Help, stop me! Oh, it's broken! Damn! How do you stop this engine? I can't stop. Stop me. Mummy! Right. A cart consumes 1 litre an hour, and the tank contains 5 litres of petrol. Thus the solution is to keep going round like this until evening. Or... to dunk it in the sea. I'm going, I'll do it. Courage, my dear. Mummy! MANICURIST SAVED BY BILLIONAIRE The celebrated financier Alexandre Dumourier saves young girl from death! Is this the start of an idyll between Cinderella and Prince Charming? EXCLUSIVE: FIFTH MARRIAGE FOR ALEXANDRE DUMOURIER? Tosh! Arch-tosh! The invention of journalists, tall tales. Thanks, you're too kind. Your daughter. Hello. Is that you, Babette? What, my engagement? Sorry, my girl, but none of it is true. Excuse me, I must work. Goodbye. Your partners in New York. - Hello, Richard? The banks can't reduce their credit based on gossip. Reassure them: I'm single, and I'm staying that way. Yes? Yes? Listen to me, Edouard, you're my son, don't make jokes of that sort. If I wanted to remarry, I wouldn't let you know like this. Enough! Enough! Call that idiot for me. - What idiot? Her from the hairdressers. It's Mirabeau. Hello? Listen, Mirabeau. That is, I mean to say... dear Solange. When you know how to swim and you see someone drowning, you dive in, do you not? Well, that's what I did. Good evening. The hairdressers. - Which hairdressers? That of the young person in question. Private calls are not allowed during opening hours. Call my chauffeur, I'm going there. Miss Caroline, please. Caroline! - Caroline! Thank you. Here, here, I'm coming! Yes? What is it? Mr Dumourier wants to see you. He has an appointment? No. He's waiting outside, in the car. He can wait. I'm busy. Mr Dumourier is not in the mood for joking around. That's convenient, because neither am I. Congratulations! Your publicity is working well. In business, you have a very big name, but before using mine, you need to consult me. Next, you are going to publish a retraction. Insolent, for good measure! You've used me without my consent. I'm in hairdressing, and your millions are of no interest to me. That's enough of that... Not at all! I want a retraction, otherwise you don't get to talk. She's fearless! - Good. He thinks he can get away with anything. I've had enough scandals for today. Come on, get in. But I... - Get in! Leon, what are you waiting for? Step on it. Where are we going? Ideally to a place where there are no journalists. Very good, sir. And now, you're going to hear me out. - Ah no! That's enough. Know that your blackmail about this engagement does not impress me, not at all. If you have a financial crisis, I am not here to get you out of it. Sir! I haven't finished. It amuses you that your friends see you going for a spin in the latest Rolls. When the car is recent, the owner is old. What a drag! It's not my fault. Really? Yes. And I'm furious as well! Well, I see but one way for us to get out of this, we must go to the editor-in-chief of the newspaper and together, we will demand a retraction. Oh no! I left a chap with his fingers in hot water. The longer he stays, the less the chance of getting burned. Leon, phone Mr Max Cornu that I will be dropping in shortly. Yes. He's not such a bad sort. And he wouldn't want any harm to come to anyone he writes about. I'm not going there like this! Things like this, they need doing immediately or never. Mr Cornu's secretary says that he can't see you... before 6pm. 6pm? Another hour and a half, heck! I'm out of here. - Out of the question! Then I'm staying put. You seem the kindly sort, especially when you're breathless. And if I bought you an ice cream? An ice cream? Absurd. Stupid. Nonsensical. Delicious, by the way. It must be 20 years since I've eaten one. It shows. Don't rush it like that! If my partners could see me now. - It may be they couldn't talk. You know, eating an ice cream, in our times... Ah! Shall we go in? We'll have fun. Let's go! All you have to do is let yourself go. You can relax. Here, we forget about it all. That's why they say this is an enchanted river. Very interesting. I am lamentable. Oh no, you must believe in yourself. Have self-confidence. Ready, aim... Fire! Miserable, I tell you. I'll never get the hang of this. You see? What do you want? I'm sorry to interrupt, but the secretary called to say that you have a meeting in a quarter of an hour. Well, rearrange it for tomorrow. What are you waiting for? Do what you were told. So, what are we doing now? No need to introduce myself. In Parisian restaurants, your plate has often rubbed shoulders with mine. Instead of using serviettes, I've noticed that you prefer to use a rag. Yes, goddammit! You have foul headlines, and in scaling the walls of peoples' private lives, you engage not in sport but in... defamation. Perfect! As long as your slander pertained to others, I didn't care. But when your cronies start to leave smears on Alexandre Dumourier, like a snail in the salad... Silence! What are you doing? - I'm going to retract. Easy, huh? When you're scared, that word rushes to your mouth. The fake news, then the retraction, and then next time, we play it all over again. Your little system requires the staff to write an article on Page 2. Very good. If you intend to write about me and on my supposed idyll with Miss Caroline, at least publish the truth! The truth... I'm taking notes. The truth is: Caroline is the most delectable girl I know. She is cheerful, lively, intelligent. She has heart, courage, indulgence, and it would be idiotic not to enjoy it. In short, sir, the truth is I'm marrying her. I have the honour of saying goodbye. You're crazy! The ice cream has made you do this? You buy, you sell, and no thought for the merchandise. Caroline! Listen, Caroline. I left a guy in hot water... It'll be cold by now. All this so that in place of a retraction, they'll publish a marriage announcement. It takes two to get married. - We are, you and me. With Cornu as witness and his reporters as best men. It's not bad, but it lacks one essential: you haven't even asked what I think. Well, I am asking what you think. Well, I give my consent. It's agreed. Gigi! - Yes? Two aspirin, quick. What's happened? Oh! Close the curtains and switch off the radio. I was having my sun bath. Bring me a cold compress. At least explain yourself. You remember the hurricane that devastated Martinique? Yes. So what? - I'm marrying his twin brother. And what's he called? Alexandre. If you knew, Gigi... What charm, what authority, what character! Dynamite in a suit. He leads me like a regiment during the war. Ah, I'm happy! To Caroline's happiness! My little Caro! And to her illustrious fiancé. And for Caroline, hip hip hip... - Hurrah! My compliments. Fickle so-and-so. To the health of my pals. Say, look who's over there. Maxime! Maxime, what are you doing there? Will you offer me a drink as well? - Of course. Anyway, it wouldn't be the first time. Firstly, we should kiss. Here. It's nice you came. I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye. Leave where? On service. They've assigned me to Rambouillet. Ah! We have a house in Poigny-la-Foret, near Rambouillet. I'll introduce you to my husband. Too little for me. Anyway, I'm not worried about you. You're an intelligent girl. You've just proved it, since you're marrying a big cheese. Good. I wish you happiness and to have lots of little billionaires. Idiot. 8 o'clock, already! Oh, you there! I must leave you. - Oh! This evening, I'm going to be presented to my in-laws, so I need to sort myself out and flick through a dictionary so I can make a good impression. I am very moved. He has two children, I'll adore them. In the morning, I'll stroll in the Bois, and in the evening, I'll wash them. Good night, little Caroline. Good night. I am happy to present to you my son Doudou, Edouard, and my daughter Bab, Elisabeth. Another sorbet, mother-in-law? No, thank you. Mother-in-law must prefer pastries. You will not be disappointed: he's a sugar daddy. I hate these jokes. For once, you've introduced us to someone nice. Good. I've decided that we will be married on the 15th at noon in Poigny-la-Foret. It will be a small affair. You, Edouard, you would do well to visit the hairdresser's. You, go to Dior and tell them to send me the bill. You have any family? No, nobody. Perfect... I mean pity. Have you thought of a witness? I wanted to bring my friend Gigi. Go for Gigi. Daddy, your phone call. - What phone call? Yes, Daddy, you know, New York. Oh yes. I must go. Take this opportunity to get to know each other and become good friends all the sooner. Good night, Bab. Good night, Doudou. Good night, Caro. You are nice... all three of you. This makes kind of a big family. Come on, let's play some records. You're very kind. We are going to be thick as thieves. Daddy's choices get better and better. Of the ones we've met, you are the most likeable. But you are very young. You'll have to take your apprenticeship to obtain as much as the others. The others? - Yes, the earlier ones. They were very clever, less pretty than you, but they knew the score. First thing: know how to take from the old. He signs cheques in the afternoon. In the morning, he's tired of writing. Let him go to his circles. If he loses, he'll tell you nothing, if he wins, he'll give you a nice present. Digestion is his favourite moment. That's how I got my Jag, one afternoon after we'd let him eat half a spiked cake. My coat is from 1am in the morning. He couldn't take it any more. I wore him down. There's enough sugar to go around, everyone gets his share. Okay, then? We're on the same page? He's not always fun, so when you want a change of scenery, we can go out together. I know a ton of boys. Good. You are too kind. But I want to go to bed, so we'll have to talk again another time. Good night! We want to make your job easier, but if you have your own method... We won't be offended. Dad says that at our age, we cannot learn too much. Well I never! That must have been wildly amusing, your family dinner! Do you realise I have a son of 18 and a daughter of 22? At least you won't have to get up at night to rock their cradle. Secondly, I'm marrying sugar. What are you talking about? I think I'm in the process of making a mistake, Gigi. Everyone thinks I'm getting married for the money. Everyone, you hear me, even you. Let people think that, it's all they can do. You'll have the Rolls, the villa, the swimming pool. You don't make love with a swimming pool. When you leave Chanel with an outfit worth half a million, they'll grasp that you're no birdbrain. I don't want them to say that I married a bank account. Don't care about the opinions of others. Sure, but I care about mine. My self-regard is worth everything to me. And once married, I'll be a billionaire's bauble! I want to drop the whole thing. Fascinating, I'm sure! You know, the competition is tough: one billionaire per 200,000 girls, my dear, no more. But I've told you I don't care about his millions! There's nothing to be done but to tell him. Explain to him that... Impossible. He's a hurricane. He'll cut me off, and ten minutes later, I'll be in front of the mayor. You could say no. - He'll say yes in my place. Then it's simple: tomorrow morning, you enter his office, you steel yourself, and you tell him... Alexandre, I've been thinking, it's definitive, I can't marry you any more! Don't argue, I can't marry you any more. It's definitive. Yes, completely, definitive and irrevocable! You don't understand? I can't marry you any more, and I will not change my mind. I'll start again. I enter his office, I open the door, I steel myself and I say... Alexandre, I've been thinking, I... But... What's happened? Caroline, my dear, I release you. You were a beautiful dream, but now, I no longer have the right to dream. But, Alexandre, explain yourself. Caroline, you might as well know right now. I'm ruined. Now there are only minutes left, before I must start to economise. Ruined? Yes. They've started proceedings against me. The police will arrive shortly. The police? In business, if you succeed, they give you a medal. If the stock market crashes, you find yourself in prison. Marketplace honesty doesn't consist of doing things seriously, of being honest at all. What it takes, is happening along at the right time. I was mistaken, the capital has flown, I can do nothing but depart. Going where? Very far... re-starting from scratch, starting anew, because everyone has abandoned me. But I haven't abandoned you. Yes. Like my son, like my daughter, like my friends. When the ship sinks, the rats desert it. I won't allow you to say that. I'm staying. Or rather, I'm going. With you! Really, Caroline? You'd do that? Yes. This crisis changes everything for me. Good. Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go Quick, Alexandre, the police! We'll have to risk it. Take the side streets, they'll be clear. They'll be on the look-out for us. - You think? Ah, I'm sure of it. A black 404 is following us. We'll shake it off easily. What are you doing? The red light. - Don't stop! I'm not stopping. Bravo! Where's the 404? Vaporised. You don't have a revolver? - No, excuse me. Now, a DS races us. - No problem. We got them! It gets worse! - What are you saying? Two motorbikes are chasing us. I've run eight red lights, it's to be expected. What? - In war you do what it takes. A dose of 200? - Oh yes! Let's go. Faster! Do you still see them? No. They've sounded the retreat. Where are we? In Poigny-la-Foret, outside my country house. This is reckless, the police might be waiting. I doubt it. Thank you, Jerome, you can retire. Caroline, my dear, I have a big confession to make. Another one? What is it, this time? Caroline, I'm not ruined. Ah? Strike a light! Everybody told me you are a materialist. I wanted to put it to the test, you passed with flying colours. Bravo for the comedy. You know, in business... You are reassured. Fully. Totally. Madly. You are wrong. Why? Because this morning, before your little comedy, I was coming to break my engagement. Why didn't you do so? Because I was waiting until you were bailed out. That's done. Good night, Alexandre. - Caroline! My dear... Why were you ready to follow a poor man to South America, and why, when he's rich, do you no longer want him? I am not a billionaire's plaything! I never said that. Because manicures are not listed on the stock exchange, and you can buy everything but not Caroline! Bravo! I love your frankness, your honesty and your fury. Tomorrow morning, 8am, we will marry. Tomorrow morning? Yes. I'm bringing forward the date of the ceremony. I will tell the mayor "no". It doesn't matter: the mayor... is me. But you're not going to marry yourself! My deputy will replace me. He's a man of mine. You are a monster! No, simply a man whom nobody can resist. DuPont de Nemours, Rockefeller, Onassis... Nobody can escape me, little Caroline. The banks, the villas, the châteaux, it's not enough. As long as you haven't bought a prison, Caroline will continue to be free! Childishness... Out of there at last! Two hours to tell him four words. Taxi, please! I hate you! When men are with their family, they lack gallantry. What a dumb thing I was about to do! Caroline, you will have no dessert until the end of the month. He won't stop? And the grand restaurants and the Rolls, that's all over. Freedom takes the metro! Ah, finally! Caroline, get in at once. Little Caroline... Caroline! Halt! I said halt! Caroline! Firing range. DANGER. Restricted area. Taxi! Check that out. A woman! - You think you're on the Champs-Elysees or what? She's a hitch-hiker. She's blonde and looks attractive. Let me see. It's Caroline! What's that idiot doing there? You know her? Cut the gas. Are you nuts? It's Caroline. We're picking her up. - Are you crazy? It's you? Don't make that face. For once, you're in the right place at the right time. Quick, help me up. Hurry, I said. Caroline! Little Caroline! Caroline! Come on, forward. - Forward! Let's go! Didn't you see the sign? I saw it, but I didn't take any notice. How old are you? Class of 37, risen from the ranks. Risen from the ranks? Well, I'm returning to them, old pal. I'm rejoining the brilliant cohort of mobilised bachelors. Thank you. I'll never forget what you've done for me. Think of the future, and remain calm. Three weeks in a cell, it's well worth it. Reassure yourself, dear, the nonsense is over. I've been through just about everything. Anyway, you couldn't understand. Well then? Do you have a fresh interest in the rising generation? Passionately. Right face! Soldiers on leave, dismissed. What are you doing tonight? - Shall we go dancing? Where do you live? I invite you to a party. Can we go for a walk together? Okay. But at my command. Forward... march! # When - Pom, pom, pom # # you are a pretty girl of 20 # # And... - Pom, pom, pom # # when you find the man who loves you # # And that you love # # Even... - Pom, pom, pom # # if he has not yet left his regiment # # you... - Pom, pom, pom # # don't think at all of 40-year-old men # # Because love # # is more important # # than the largest cars and the biggest apartments # # Better to have # # a little patience # # Since these young people in 20 years # # will be 40-year-old men # # When... - Pom, pom, pom # # you are a pretty girl of 20 # # You... - Pom, pom, pom # # say that you would like to find a man # # who is a man and... # # Pom, pom, pom # # ...the best solution obviously # # Is... - Pom, pom, pom # # to choose from among the 40-year-old men # # But love # # is more important # # than the biggest cars and the largest apartments # # Better sometimes to show # # a little patience... #
