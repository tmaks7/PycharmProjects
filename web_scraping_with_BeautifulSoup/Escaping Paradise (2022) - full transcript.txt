Do you want subtitles for any video? -=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=- Mr... Mr... Williams, sir. Let me get this correct. You saw the victim last night around... Williams: Midnight. We don't want to be involved. Madam, a woman was just killed. We're going to see this investigation through whether you like it or not. Now if you don't mind, start from the beginning. Williams, voice-over: We actually didn't have any plans to go anywhere until last week. This was a last-minute trip for my anniversary. Hey! Foul. Williams, voice-over: Thanks to my friend Carl. You laying bricks out here, man. - You building a house? - It was the wind. The wind messed up your layups, too? - Heh. - Ha ha ha! Man, shoot the ball, man. Come on. You have a anniversary coming up, right? Heh. Can't believe it's been 5 years. So where you taking here for your big 5? I hope it's nice. I don't know yet, man. She loves Chinese. - OK. Yes. - So I was thinking maybe a 5-star restaurant like Mr. Chow's, you know what I'm saying? Come on, bro. It's your big 5. Listen. Me and Vivian, we went to Italy last year. It was amazing! I don't like to travel. You know that. Mission still messing with you? Those trips never happened, Carl, right? Past in the past. Zena's actually never left the country before. What? Are you serious? Look. I got one for you. Oh! Here we go! If you make it... you can take Zena to whatever Chinese restaurant you want to take her to... Jimmy Choo's, Gyu-Kaku... - Mr. Chow's, man! - Mr. Chow's. Mr. Chow's. - Don't disrespect Mr. Chow, OK? - Oh, all right, all right. All right. Mr. Chow's, but if you miss it, you got to take her somewhere exotic. Sounds expensive. You paying? Come on, bro. There's a lot of good deals. You could take her to Thailand, Bali, the Philippines. Philippines. The Philippines. - From right here? - You can shoot from anywhere because you been bricking, so it doesn't matter. You know, they used to call me Floyd Jordan in middle school, right? Flaw Jordan. Floyd, voice-over: I was hesitant at first, but the more I thought about it... the more it sounded like a good idea. After all, you only live once, right? OK. The hotel is 7 minutes away from the airport. Yeah, but which way? I don't know. Hey! Hey! What's up? Man: Your fist time in Cebu? Yes, it's our first time. I take you anywhere you want to go. Less than taxi. - You're not a taxi? - Don't worry. I will take care of you. Where do you want to go? I think we're fine. Uh, Fantasy Lodge. How much? Yes, yes. 100 pesos. Good price. That's less than two bucks. You trust this kid? You got a deal. Kid: Great! The only problem is I can't drive up here. You have to walk down to the street. Airport policy. The street? How tall are you? Like, 6'2.5". You play NBA. Ha ha! He wish. Ha ha! Basketball big in Philippines. I play on very good team. You play basketball? We have tournament next Sunday at noon. Play with us. I'm always up for a game of hoops. Oh, no. I'm sorry. We're not doing that on this trip, right, Floyd? Kid: OK. I understand, sir. No problem. Is this what we're riding in? Hop on. Just a few stops, and then Fantasy Lodge. A few stops? Just think of it is as an Uber Pool. Yeah. Oh. That's how you feel? Yo. ♪ I got the call now, my baby can't wait ♪ ♪ Turn up the style every day ♪ ♪ I come ♪ ♪ We're making a run, run, run ♪ Floyd, voice-over: Our trip got off to a cool start.

We just need your address so we can contact you for more information, OK? Fantasy Lodge. Chief, voice-over: Room number. Floyd, voice-over: 215. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Aah! I love this!

Ohh. - Here you go. - Very good. Ok. - This view is amazing. - Mmm. Yes, it is. Ha! I was talking about the beach. I was talking about you. Trying to butter me up? - Is it working? - Mm-hmm.

Hi, ma'am. I'm so sorry, but table is reserved. Oh. Oh. We figured that since there was basically no one here that we could sit wherever. Sorry. You can't sit here. Any other table is fine. I'm just as confused as to why. This is for a VIP, sir. - Who is this VIP? - Floyd, let's just move, I would be this VIP. - Hello. - So sorry, sir. I tired to tell them. It's all right, it's all right. It's not a big deal. Hey, man. My bad. We can... we can move. No, no, no, no. Don't. Please, please, please. Sit, sit. As long as you don't mind us sitting with you. - It's your table. - Heh heh. Start them out. Can I get something for you to drink? Let me guess... Mai Tai. - How'd you know? - Heh! Popular island drink, but if I might be so bold, the Mestizo are to die for here. Oh. Well, done. I'll have a Mestizo. Oh. I'll have a shot of Hennessey. I'm sorry, sir, but don't have Hennessey. Ha ha ha! Well, that settles it then. 4 Mestizos, please, and make sure this goes on my tab. Off you go. Thank you. So what's the story? Globetrotters I reckon. Actually, this is my first time out the country. Are you serious? Well, welcome to Cebu. Where are you guys from? - Los Angeles. - Ah. L.A. Not really a fan to tell you the truth. All that traffic. Venice Beach. My God. I've never seen so many drug dealers in one place. Nobody from L.A. goes to Venice Beach. And if you give up your car, you'll never be stuck in the traffic. Ha ha ha! Sorry. Uh, what's your name? I'm sorry. I've been so rude. I'm Kane. Floyd. This is my wife Zena. Zena. What a beautiful name? Ha ha ha! And I'm good at this. Wait. Honeymoon. - Anniversary. - Aw! I was close, though. So close. Congratulations are still in order, though. Thanks. And you are? Oh, this is Nihla. She doesn't speak English, I'm afraid, so you don't have to pretend to be polite, but, my God, she's pretty to look at. Hi, Nihla. Nice to meet you. Kane: Heh heh heh. So you're a regular here? Same time every day. This place has the best pasta on the whole island. Tell me have you ever had that street food out there, that balut? Do yourself a favor. Don't. It's disgusting. Well, apart from that, though, you guys picked a beautiful spot for your anniversary. We plan to see the whole city. Well, of course you are because you just happen to be so lucky as to run into the best tour guide on the island. You are not short of confidence, huh? I don't need to be. We picked up this tourist guide. It's a map from the, uh, hotel. Ooh. Let me see. Ha ha ha! You look like a tourist, Floyd. You want to avoid that. You'll get charged 3 times as much for everything. You know what you guys need? A trip on a boat, my boat. You have a boat? I sure do. I have several. My baby, my real baby is my yacht, but she's on the southside of the island in Moalboal, but I happen to have a bangka boat right here at the marina. It's yours. Thanks for the offer, man, but we actually have plans. We do? You wanted to see the Lapulapu statute, right? Oh, we can do that anytime. Right? Zena: Yeah. Come on, Floyd. Live a little. You're on your anniversary. What's... what's the worst that could happen? Come on, Floyd. Oh, I see it. He wants to say yes. He wants to say it. I can see it your eyes, Floyd! You want to say it. Zena, make him say it. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes! Say it. Yes! Yeah! Well, I'm gonna propose a toast to new friends. To new friends. Cheers! Is this what you do every day? Nope. Twice a day. Ha ha ha! I love the water, Floyd. Fucking can't get enough of it. It's part of the reason I came here. Hmm. I could get used to this. You wouldn't. That's the great thing about it, Floyd. It's fucking amazing every day. I love it. How long have you lived here? I'm on a kind of, uh, extended vacation. You know? Stay here as long as I want, as long as I like it, until I don't. I don't blame you. Hmm. That Zena there, she's a beauty, Floyd. Tough as nails, as well, I'll bet. Tougher. Heh heh heh. It takes a strong man to keep a woman like that happy. Heh heh heh. I'm just messing with you. Ha ha ha! What about Nihla? How did you two meet, being that she doesn't speak English. Right. Well, I picked up some Cebuano from my time on the island. You pick up phrases here or there. It's enough. Floyd: You must have done well for yourself, being able to afford all of this. Yeah, I did all right. What exactly do you do? Ha ha! Floyd, let's not ruin a beautiful day by talking about boring work. Besides, it's complicated, you know? Hey, babe. Check out the island. It's beautiful. Oh, yeah. Whoa, whoa. This is where we stop! Why here? - See the island ahead of us? - Yeah. It's actually got a military base on it. A couple hundred more feet, and we'd be in their waters. Don't think anyone wants to spend the afternoon staring down the barrel of an AR-15. Yeah. Let's just stop here. Good idea. Floyd, voice-over: I'm not gonna act like Kane wasn't a little odd... Kane: Mmm! Floyd, voice-over: But he seemed harmless. You read my fucking mind, gorgeous. Floyd, voice-over: A rich man with a young Filipino girlfriend who doesn't speak English? It's not necessarily uncommon. So when he invited us to Kawasan Falls early the next morning, we decided to go, but I should have paid more attention. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Someone didn't enough sleep last night. It's the time zone. Well, shake it off, Floyd. Today we're rocking and rolling. - We're with you. - Yeah? All right. Let's sing the chorus together then. I never heard of this song before in my life, have you? Uh-uh. Never heard of this song? What planet are you from? Earth. Where are they from? Uh, England, mate. The cultural hub of the universe. That explains it. I don't know about that. Ah. Oh, let me give you an example. Uh, perhaps you've heard of a little band called the Boatles... oh... The Beatles. Typical. I knew he was gonna say that. Ends all arguments. All right. How about the Rolling Stones then? - They're from London? - Damn right they are. What about the Who, Radiohead? Any of these sounding familiar? What have you guys got? Floyd: Our solo artists trump your entire catalogue. Uh... Floyd: Michael Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, James Brown. Eric Clapton, Elton John, David Bowie. Bob Marley. Hey! No, no, no, no, no. That doesn't count. That doesn't count. He's from Jamaica. It's close enough. Clo... - Tupac. - Pfft! Ha. Sorry. I don't think all that hip-hop shit is music at all actually. What? Kane: Oh, actually. Let me liven this up. We need something rousing. Driver, that Bluetooth on? No, no, no. You don't have to. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. We're going there. Hold on one sec, one sec.

Take that, Nihla. Sir, sir, 100 pesos for parking. No, man. I come here all the time. I know it's free. We want to go straight down there. It's a bit of a walk, but it should be worth it. Boy: No. 100 pesos. New rule. Hey! Listen. I just fucking told you no! I realize you're just trying to fucking hustle some money, but you're not gonna be getting it from me, so fuck off! - 50 then, sir. - Oh, my God! Would you fucking listen to me?

Here you go. Floyd, voice-over: I don't know who wrote it, but it wasn't Kane. So tell me something, Floyd. You're a military man, right? Because I can sense some training there. That was a lifetime ago. How'd you know? Eh, you're giving me all these "No brother left behind" kind of vibes. All-American hero vibes. You're giving me only child vibes. Ha ha ha! No, no, no, no, no. I'm the youngest of 4 brothers. Trust me, mate. I had to fight everything I had. Floyd: You mean, like that kid you pummeled back there? You know, sometimes, people only understand one language... force. That kid learned a valuable lesson back there, not to fuck with a bigger dog than you. He'll be all right. Kindness isn't weakness. Heh. Maybe, but it depends on who you're dealing with, mate. Floyd: You're right. Sometimes, people need to be put in their place. Eh, watch these planks. They're a little old. This is crazy. Heh. Oh, my God. Ha ha ha! Am I right? Ohh! Ohh! This is amazing! Wow! Look at that! You see this, babe? Can we cancel our return trip home? Ha ha ha! I know it was a bit of a trek, but isn't hat 100% worth it? What do you think, Floyd? Just like you see in the movies. Nah. It's better. And you know the only thing better than looking at it is diving right in. Come on, mate. Let's go! Uh-uh. What is he talking about? Going for a swim.

I get to stroke my dick whatever time I want. To each his own. Kane: What did you say you did for a living, Floyd? Construction. When it's slow, I help my friend out at his car shop. Hmm. So a builder and a mechanic. I figure there's more to you, but you're a modest fella, so you're not gonna say, are you, Floyd? Ha ha ha! Well, I don't have the padded accounts like you do, but we do all right. What are you talking about, mate? A little goes a long way here, like a very long way. You and Zena move here, you could live like royalty, you know that? Well, tell me, Kane, how do you make your money? I could... but then I'd have to kill you. Ha ha ha! Heh heh heh. What are you guys talking about? Oh, hey. Uh, Kane was just telling me how lucky I was to have you as my wife. Mmm. Smart man. I have an idea. I think we should hit the city tonight. No. No, no. I'm way too tired for that. This jetlag is catching up with me, and I... I need to get my 10 hours. I don't think I sold this right. Guys, you're here probably for another week, right? This is Friday night in Cebu City. I guarantee you there's nothing else like it in the whole world. You need to check it out. Come on. YOLO. You only live once, right? The kids say that, right? Am I right? Floyd: No. No, no. We're done. Ahh. No. Listen. We appreciate the hospitality, the boat. Everything has been amazing. We're just too tired. Zena, I can't twist your arm? Shoot. Heh heh. I had to try. And you guys got to forgive me. I sit here, and I'm... happy, I'm having my cigar, but Nihla doesn't speak any English, and then I finally find two people who not only speak the language but I can actually shoot the shit with? I get a little excited, I get carried away, and I want to soak you up for as long as I can, and normally it's about this time of night I realize I hadn't spoken to anybody all day. Like, an entire day without talking to anybody... but I get it. I get it. You're on your honeymoon... Your... your anniversary, I mean, you know? You need to reconnect, rekindle the romance. You're young. Heh heh. I get it. Don't you worry about Kane. Kane's OK. Look at him. He's living his best life. Ha ha ha! Ain't nobody got to worry about Kane. Floyd, you should go. - No. - Make it a fellas' night. - Uh. Are you sure? - Don't worry about me I will be fine. Just take me to the hotel, and I'll rest up for tomorrow. Wait. Is this... is this happening? Floyd? Ok. - Yes! - One drink. One quiet drink. - Then I'm done. - You have my word. I'll take Zena back, and I'll freshen up. Zena: And I'll gas up the motorbikes. Motorbikes? Floyd, we're gonna have some fun tonight Floyd, voice-over: I don't know why I let him talk me into going out. I should have taken the storm as a sign and stayed my ass at the hotel. Floyd, this is a quiet drink. Floyd, voice-over: The bikini bar's where everything changed. Far from a quiet drink. Kane: Ha ha ha! Ladies, go easy on him. I've only got him on loan for the night. What are we drinking, Floyd? Feeling adventurous. I'll try your, uh, Mestizo. No, no, no. Here, boy, here we drink champagne. Oh. Champagne it is. Champagne, sweetheart, on my account. Want a dance? No. I'm... I'm good. You don't think I'm sexy? No. You're beautiful. I'm here with my friend. Give us a minute. He's just easing into it, all right? Go on. Off you go, sweetheart. Go on. Off you go. - You're a wild boy. - Ha ha ha! Hey. Yeah, yeah. Everything's OK. Hey, Jinx! Make sure that gets to the people that need it. Heh heh heh. - Who was that? - Oh, he runs the place, but he comes over to the house to play a bit of poker. I lost, so I owe him some money. - Ah. - Ha ha ha! What's up with you and security? You can never be too careful, Floyd. No. I'm just trying to make sure nobody's running up in here looking for you, and by you, I mean me. Kane: Ha ha ha! Come on. Surely a guy with a gun doesn't scare you people. "You people"? Americans. Ha! Relax, Floyd. Please. You're having a drink with one of the most respected men on the island, and I'm trying to stay humble when I do that, but I can't! I am! They fucking love me here! You put this on my tab, OK? Let's unwrap her. Ahh. - Ohh! - Whoa! Ha ha ha! - The good kind. - The best. - Cheers, mate. - Cheers. So why us? I mean, the hospitality, you know, showing us around. Because we're friends, right? Heh heh heh! Floyd, I remember what it's like landing on the island for the first time. It's electrifying, but you need to know the right people, somebody to show you around all the best places. That's me. I'm paying it forward because you were the one with the balls to steal my fucking table! I like that. It reminds me of me as a young man... Ballsy, you know? You're gonna be all right here. In fact, I'm gonna show you a great time. This one's one of my favorites. Flower, get your sweet ass down here! Oh, no, no. Yeah, yeah. I told you I was gonna show you a good time, and I am. Flower, sweetheart, give my buddy Floyd a dance. Hey. Do whatever he wants, all right? Show him a good time. That's a good girl. Go on, Floyd. Relax. You're on holiday. Look. She's not gonna bite you. I didn't pay her enough money bite you. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Y-you don't have to dance. I'll dance for you, sir, as Mr. Kane said. How do you know his name? Everyone knows his name. Heh. Who is he really? I can't say any more. Just... just relax. You don't have to worry about that. Heh. Floyd: Look. I... I won't tell him. I'm afraid Mr. Kane is gonna get angry at me. Why are you so scared of him? Mr. Kane... he used to come here many, many times. That's where he met Nihla, my cousin. Nihla's your cousin? She used to dance here? Yes. A long time ago. Top dancer, too. He keeps Nihla away from her family, and every time she tries to leave, he threatens to kill her. She's very afraid of him. That's why she pretends to not understand English. She speaks English? Yes. She used to teach me. Sir, Nihla knows the truth about Mr. Kane. Just ask her yourself. I'm not lying. Oh, no. That's too much. It's OK. No. Take it. Help your family. You get your money's worth, Floyd? - I've had better. - Ah. Ha ha ha! Good night, right? Oh, shit! I'm sorry. I know it's late. Am I gonna get you in trouble? No, no, no. I'll be all right. - Sure? - Yeah. Listen. Blame it on me. I was gonna do that anyway. Ha ha ha! You're all right, Floyd. You're all right. Listen. That stripper... I don't know what she said to you, man. I don't mean to get awkward, but these girls, you know, they don't know what the fuck they're talking about sometimes. They're coked up half the time they're here at work. Always. It's just kind of their job, but it does mean that they talk a lot of shit. Floyd: Mmm. No, no, no. She was just giving me some recommendations on some local street food. - Really? - Yeah. What did I say about the street food? - It was shit. - Shit! - Yes. - That's right, mate. Take my word over some stripper's. Ah. Look. Why don't you take a cab home? You'll be home for the missus quicker. Yeah? A little less pissed off at you. - You sure? - Yeah. Me and Jinx will take the bikes back tomorrow morning, you know? I'm gonna hang out here for a bit more. Fancy one more dance, you know? - OK. - And listen. Thanks for hanging out, Floyd. It means a lot. I hope you and the missus had fun today. - It was great. - Yeah. Get home safe. Fantasy Lodge, please. Hey! What are you doing? It's none of your business. Roughing up a girl like that. What's your problem? Jinx: I don't care. No one's stopping you. Get back in the cab. I will, but I'm taking her with me. - Let's go. - Don't make this bigger problem than it needs to be. Unh! Ohh! Jinx: I tried to warn you. - Come on. Let's go. - What did you do? What do you mean? He could have hurt you. He still will. Come on. I'll get you home. No. I can't! If you're gonna help someone, help Nihla. Leave me alone. To warn you. Really? Unh! Babe. Look who decided to get out of bed. Thanks for letting me know you were leaving. You were sleeping so peacefully, I didn't want to wake you. Somebody's feeling good. Well, I got my full 10 hours... Hmm. Zena: my skin is popping... - Yep. - Got my food and my drink. What else does a girl need? - Me. - Mmm. I do. How was your night? What happened? Got into a fight. - A fight? - Mm-hmm. Floyd, what the hell happened? Last night, Kane took me to a strip club. A strip club? There was a girl there, who gave me a lap dance, but we talked, and she basically said Nihla was being held against her will and that she knew how to speak English. - What?! - Yeah. Kane caught wind of it and had her beat up. I had to defend her, and Kane's bodyguard kicked me in my face. Oh, my God. Aw. Are you OK? Yeah. I'll be fine. When I see Kane, I'm whupping his ass. Floyd: Ha ha ha! Playing with you. No. Babe, we came here to enjoy ourselves, have a good time, no more fights. Says the guy with the busted eye. Don't worry. I'll take care of you. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. Ahh. My shoulder hurts, too. - Really? - And my back. Yeah. Oh, what else? Everywhere really. - He got me pretty good. - He did? -Mm-hmm -Aw. Well, I got you. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Mmm. Tell me about this little dance you had last night. Did you enjoy it? Thank you. Thank you. - Huh? - Did you enjoy it? You heard me. - No, I did not. - Really? - Nope. - Look me in my face and tell me you didn't enjoy it. - With my glasses on? - Mm-hmm. I can see your eyes. You know you're the only one for me. Come on now. - You're so full of it. - Heh. Wait. Excuse me. Turn that up, please. News anchor: The young woman has been identified as Connie Abo, know to friends as Flower, 19 years of age, found this morning strangled on the side of the road near the city square. Oh, shit. News anchor: Authorities are investigating... What? It's her. - The dancer? - Yes. That's her. Are you sure? Babe, I just saw her a few hours ago. That's her. That's definitely her. - She's been killed. - What?! News anchor: Anyone in the public with information about the crime... Oh, my God. Babe, you got to go to the police. You got to tell them what happened. What? I know! Well, find the family, round them all up, and offer them a fucking bunchload of money up to a certain point. What do you mean "and then what?" And then fucking get rid of them if they say no. What the fuck am I paying you for? Just get it done! Hey! Your fucking cousin's dead! Fuck's sake. ♪ "Britons" ♪ Floyd, voice-over: When we heard what happened, we knew we had to report it right away. I wish I could have done more to help, but... she didn't want to leave, and I couldn't force her. Kane is a heartless son of a bitch. I didn't expect for him to kill her. ♪ "Ever shall" ♪ Chief, voice-over: Do you have a last name for Kane? No. A description? 5'9", full beard. British. That should narrow it down. The restaurant. What restaurant? The yacht club. He has a reserved table there. If you go there, I'm sure you can find him. OK. We'll check that out. We appreciate you coming forward... Floyd and... Zena. Look. We're just trying to do the right thing. Of course. She said Nihla knows the truth about Kane. What does that mean? I don't know. Maybe we should ask her. Floyd, no. Look now. The chief said that he will handle it. Let him handle it. This is just not how I expected to spend our anniversary. Zena, a girl died because of me. Now I owe it to her to see this thing through. I promise you tomorrow we're on a boat, island hopping, finishing our vacation in style. - ok? - ok. So what's the plan? Kane: She was all up, trying to get into my business, and I... Floyd. And Zena. What a wonderful surprise. I didn't think we'd see you here. Yeah. We were just passing by, saw you sitting here, figured we'd say hi. Feel free to take a seat. Hi, Nihla. So how are you two lovebirds finding the island? - Couldn't be better. - Good. And you, Floyd? Get home OK last night? Barely. That's a nasty, little bruise you got. Put something on that. It's just a scratch. I can barely feel it, but you should see the other guy. Piss of, Jinx. Zena, is it possible that you are more beautiful today than you were yesterday? I told her already this morning. - You beat me to it? - You're a little late. Well, you're a better man than I am, Floyd. Heh heh heh. Oh! Zena: Oh. I am so sorry. It's fine, it's fine. Zena, it's fine. That might stain. No, no, no. Honestly, she doesn't need any help. I can just get this out in the bathroom. Come on. Aren't you forgetting something? Be quick. Women. Sorry about that. She can be a little clumsy sometimes. You know, she didn't strike me as the clumsy type. Oh, I am so sorry. Psst. Nihla, now look now. We came here to help you, all right? I know you speak English. If you want our help, you have to tell me now. Talk to me now. Now are you in danger? You know, we should talk about what happened last night. What happened last night? Between you and the girl. Look, Floyd. I asked my man to go and have a word with her. He says, "OK," but then he went a bit too rough. That's the problem with these guys. They say they understand, and they don't. I can't be held responsible for another man's actions. She was just a girl, Kane. Floyd, I know. I rung the family myself this morning. I feel terrible. Zena: We're leaving in a couple of days. Now if you want our help, you're have to tell me now. If you want me to get a message to your family... - No, no. - If you me to tell your family... No. You don't know who you're dealing with. Well, tell me. - He's dangerous. - How? Kane's real name is Bobby Cooper. He's a fugitive from England. Police might want to have a word with you about it. They already did. Me and the chief go way back. We play golf every Sunday, Floyd. Matter of fact, I think they want another word with you. Weren't you the last person to see her alive? What did he do? He killed 3 people in a bank heist 7 years ago and flew here to Cebu. He uses his fortune for influence. Money goes a long way here. What are you playing at, Floyd? It's a very dangerous game you're starting, and before you start it, you should probably think about who you're playing against. Ha! I mean, me and you are two lucky son of a bitches, Floyd. Look at us, sat here in paradise with beautiful women beside us. I mean, just imagine if something happened to one of those beautiful women. Let me tell you something about me, about how I run my life, my... my business. I value one commodity... loyalty. If I welcome somebody in with open arms, if I treat them well, if I'm kind, then you know what I expect back, Floyd? Open honesty between us. Now have I given you any reason whatsoever to think that that doesn't apply to you? No, you haven't. Good. Because I was worried that you and I didn't understand each other. Please. I really have to go. Mmm. All cleaned up? Hey, Floyd. You think we can head back to the room for a bit? I'm not feeling well. Aw, but you just got here. Let me at least buy you a drink. No. No more Mestizos for us, but thinks for the hospitality. Anytime, Floyd. Floyd, be careful out there. Because this place is paradise... until it's not. 15 minutes, please. What? Floyd: 15 minutes. 30. 15. "Bobby... "Cooper... London, England." There's nothing here. Are you sure she said Bobby Cooper? Yeah, definitely Bobby Cooper. There is nothing here except the guy who won the hot dog eating contest in Coney Island last year. Wait. Bobby's short for what? Robert. "Robert"... "England." - Shit. - Is that him? It's definitely him. Wanted for 3 murders, including a child? Click on that link. We have to do it, Floyd, not only because of the money, but it's the right thing to do. I don't know, Zena. This is getting out of hand. You wanted to help Nihla. This is the only way we can do it. We can't trust the police here. Well, there's a e-mail on the screen. We can send a message to the British MI6, and our work is done. Man: OK. Zena: What the hell? Power's off. Cafe's closed. Everybody out now. Everybody out. Now. Out. Must be rain. You two, out now. Out. Don't look. Two guys at our 6. On the count of 3, we're gonna switch aisles and run. Count 4 booths and switch again. 1, 2, 3. This way. Go, go, go! Come on. Excuse me, sir. Watch out, watch out. Excuse me! Come on, come on, come on! Right here, right here. Let's go, let's go! Left. Come on. We're losing them. Right here. Right here. Ok. OK. Right here. Hey. Hmm? Thank you. Babe, did you leave the door open? No. Are you sure? Zena: I'm positive. - Oh. - Are you fucking kidding me? What the fuck... Did you check the safe? There's nothing in the safe. Babe! Our stuff is gone! Oh, my God, oh, my God. OK. - Where'd you put the passports? - The passports. I put them... Where'd you put the passports? I put them right here. I'm put them right here. Right here. - Oh, my God! - Babe, calm down. - Calm down, OK? - What do you mean calm down? We'll get our passports back, OK? What do you... how are we gonna get home? We'll get home. I will get us home. I will make sure we get home, OK? Promise. How'd they even find out where we were? I don't know. - The chief. - The cop? Yes, yes, OK. Thank you. What'd they say? They said we got to go to the U.S. Embassy, fill out a application. They'll issue us an emergency passport. OK. All right. How long? - 72 hours. - 3 days? We can't wait 3 days. We're not safe here. Babe... I just want to go home. OK. All right. Let's pack our shit, jump in a cab, and head to the embassy. We'll figure it out from there, OK? Ok. Woman: Sir, is everything OK? Floyd: We're checking out. Zena: Keep the fucking deposit. U.S. Consulate, please. Cebu City, IT Park. We going the right way? I hope so. Hey. Uh, we're actually headed away from the city. Which way you going? This is a shortcut. Um, no, no, no. We can... You can just pull over right here. We'll... we'll jump out. Hey. Did you hear me? Sir, can you stop the car? My man. Sir, can you pull over the car? The fucking door's locked. Sir, unlock the door. Hey! Unlock the door! Hey! Stop the car! Hey! Stop the car! Hey, man. Stop the car! Open the door! Open the fucking door! - Hey! Open the door! - Open the door! Please don't shoot. You can have whatever you want. Please don't shoot. Please, please don't shoot. Get out the car! Zena, get out the car! Floyd! Floyd! Aah! Aah! Zena! Zena: Aah! Unh! Ooh! Unh! Driver: Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Err! Driver: Ooh, ooh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Shit, shit. Zena! Noooo! Ok. Is it done? Kane? Floyd. Heh. I am... so surprised to hear your voice. Listen to me, Kane. I don't know what you want, but if you hurt Zena... Kane: Floyd, please. I'm a gentleman. I... I'm not a monster. I'm not gonna hurt Zena. I mean, I do have to fucking slit her throat but only after I get the information on exactly who you two have been talking to about me. We didn't tell anybody about you, man. We didn't talk to anybody. All we want to do is go home. Oh, mate. I'm afraid that time has been and gone, and after everything I did for you. Heh. We were friends, Floyd, and you turned on me. You get that, right? I mean, I genuinely liked you both. Such a shame. Kane, let her go. You'll never get away with this, man. Floyd... you know who I really am, so you know I've gotten away with much, much worse. Kane! Kane! Fuck! I didn't catch your name last time. Heh. You're, uh, Kane's friend. What can I do for you? Aw. Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Relax. Come on. Floyd: You know that Kane has my wife? Let's just talk about this, huh? Put the fucking stick down! All right. All right, all right, all right. Put your gun down. Right there. Put it on the table! Just be cool. Just be cool, mate, OK? There you go. Let's... let's... let's be, uh, diplomatic, all right? Let's talk about this. What do you want? What do you want, huh? Just calm... calm down, huh? Fuck. Floyd: I don't have time to play games with you. Hey, man. What are you doing? I'm gonna ask you one question, OK? OK. Uh-huh. Where does he live? I don't know. Ohh! What the fuck is wrong with you?! My fucking hand! Get the... Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey, relax. Hey. Come on, come on, come on. Last fucking chance. Where does he live? Shh, shh, shh, shh. Where is she? Who? You know who. Zena. Where is she? Nihla: I don't know. Nihla, don't lie to me. Where is she? Look. I'm so sorry. I can't help you, Floyd. What is wrong with you? This man threatens you, he threatens your family, he kills your cousin, and you just want to protect him? I am not protecting him. I'm trying to save your life here, Floyd. Save Zena's. She's the one who needs it. She tried to help you. Shh. Chief: Where is he? You want to tell me what the hell is going on? What are you talking about? I've been getting reports that you're turning my island into a warzone. Heh heh. Relax, Chief. Not even close. We're working on bringing them in. I'm afraid that time has been and gone. You had your chance. Sorry. - They're dead? - Soon. I've got the girl, but he is still out there somewhere, being a pain in my fucking ass. Did you run the name? Chief: Yes. He's black ops. He's done 3 tours of duty in Iraq. He's an expert in firearms, martial art... All right, all right, all right! I get it. Bad fucking idea to kidnap his wife. You're pushing the limit, Kane, but I'm not going to be able to continue to clean up after your shit! That's so funny because to me you look like the chief of police. You look like somebody on my payroll. Here. Here's what I owe you, and here's double your fucking pay to do exactly what I say and not ask me stupid fucking questions. You have to slow down, Kane. I can only do so much. A Band-Aid here or there, but if this gets to the mayor or someone higher... Well, don't let it get that fucking far! What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm under... a lot of pressure at work. Don't let it get that far. Come on. Please. What do you plan to do with the girl? I need to keep her alive for now. I'm gonna use her as bait. I'm gonna lure him in. Doesn't matter what his CV says. He's in love with her, so I'm gonna reel him in like a fish. He must not be allowed to leave this island. That would be very bad for the both of us. He's not going anywhere as long as she's alive and with me. He'll come for her, and when he does... we'll take care of both of them at the same time. You're a heartless son of a bitch, Kane. So what does that make you? Nihla? Fucking hell. Go on. Fuck off. You got your money. You'll forgive me if I count it first. Fine. Count it. Then take it and fuck off. Don't move. Man: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Floyd: Drop it. Easy. Agh! Stay here. Man: Ooh! This is your last chance, Nihla. You got to make a decision now. Nihla: There's only one place he might hold her hostage. Where? Jinx! Jinx, what the fuck happened? Where the fuck is Nihla? Floyd. Floyd? What kind of a wanker takes another man's wife? Get up. Get up. Get up! Get up. Get to the fucking marina. OK, Floyd. - Was that your guy? - Fuck off. You're fucking losing it, Kane. You got your money, so get out. Get out! There. Make a right. - Here? - Yeah. Our village is just right here. OK. Wait here. My uncle is very generous. He said that he and his kids can live with my cousin Ramon and you can use his home as long as we need. - He doesn't have to do that. - He is family. He wants to do it. Where does Ramon live? Just right there. Right next door. And he wants to cook for you. I don't want to intrude. No. He insists for helping me. Ok. You remember when you went onstage? You laughed so hard you peed yourself. Right? Remember, guys? You... you were cute then. Hey, Mr. Floyd. What's up? This is your cousin? Nihla: Yeah. Felix. Do you know him? Where's your wife? Is it, um... Zena. Felix: Yes. Zena. How is she? She's been kidnapped. - What? - It's true. And Flower... she's dead. I'm sorry. He won't get away with this... but I need your help. Nihla says you have a boat. We have many boats, and, yes, we can help. Thank you. He will come here looking for Nihla with many men. Look, Floyd. I don't think you can fight all of them. They will arrest my family, and they will kill you. It's better if you're not there. If Kane sends his men here, then there'll be less men guarding him in his yacht. Better chance for you to rescue your wife. No. No. I can't leave you all in danger. Man: Kane has harassed our family long enough. It is time for us to fight back, and if they arrest us, that is better than letting him win, right? Right? Hss! Ahh. Sorry. You'll survive. Won't be the first time. You've been shot before? In combat. It's very brave of you to stay with Kane to protect your family. I had no choice. He is a vicious man. He will kill anyone that will look at him for too long, but he wouldn't harm me. How can you be so sure? He's obsessed with me. Everyone has a weakness, and I am his, same as Zena is yours. Thank you. Good night and good luck, Floyd. Who? Fuck you. Let me go! Off me! Off! It's time. Nihla: Let go. Where is he? He's not here. Harboring a fugitive. That's a serious offense. How ironic coming from you. Very well. I'm going to arrest your whole family. We know. We're ready. I hope you have enough room for all of us. Take them away. You have to arrest all of us! Let this be a lesson to you all! This is what happens when you disobey the police. How they holding up? They're being detained. Kane should have less muscle. It's on us now. Felix: You know what? If this all works out, I only have one small request. What's that? My basketball tournament is coming up later today. Felix, in high school, I was on the basketball team. I didn't get much playing time because the coach had his favorites, but in the championship game, I got my shot. 10 seconds left, I got a open lane. I'm driving to the basket, I go for the layup... And you made the shot! You won the championship! I air balled, missed the entire basket. The entire basket? Oh. I say all that to say you might not want me on your team. It's OK, Mr. Floyd. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. I guess you're right. So you'll play with us? Let's focus on one thing at a time. OK. I'll ask you again later. This way. Is he dead? Not yet. Soon, but not yet. You know he's coming to kill you, right? Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Of course he is. I hope so! That's the plan. Oh, Zena. You don't get it, do you, Zena? Whilst he's being the true blue American hero, really he's just rushing his way to his watery grave. I have to kill him. I don't have a choice. But you... I don't have to kill you. Maybe we could make a deal. So what could you do for me, hmm? Unh! Remember the last one you said meant nothing to me? Well, this one means everything to me. Unh! Ohh! Floyd! I treated you like a friend, Floyd, and you betrayed me! Floyd. Aah! Ha ha ha! All we wanted to do was leave. Bullshit, Floyd! You ratted me out to the police the first chance you got! Put the knife down. Now why would I do that? Not too bad for an old man, huh? Still teach you a thing or two, huh, Floyd? Only one of us is getting off this boat. Is that right? Ohh! Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh! Are we still friends, Kane? Hmm? Floyd! Somebody, help! Floyd! Help! Floyd: Phew. Are those Kane's people? I don't think so. We may have mistakenly passed the military mark a little while back. Heh. Smart lady. Baby, can we go home? Floyd Williams of Los Angeles, you have caused quite a commotion on this peaceful island. Your dangerously violent and reckless disrespect for the citizens here is gonna make it almost impossible for me to defend you. Did they tell you Kane and his dirty-ass cops tried to kill us? Zena. Oh yeah. There... there will be a complete investigation of Mr. Kane. They have yet to find the body. What? Perhaps a shark will beat them to it. Heh heh. You know, I'm... I'm not usually involved in criminal matters. That's the job of the Filipino Justice Department, but because you're Americans, I felt I needed to step in. Seems Mr. Kane was involved in a series of bank robberies in London, and he definitely is responsible for drug trafficking right here in this country. Strictly off the record, you should be proud of yourself. On behalf of the American government, thank you. I would like to extend to you and your beautiful wife an invitation to tour this fantastic island, maybe a trip to Kawasan Falls or perhaps a little scuba diving. We could arrange it all right here. No. Uh, we're good. -We... we... we just -We just want to go home. Ambassador: Understood. I understand your passports were taken. We will issue emergency clearance, and you'll be able to board the first flight out of here. Thank you, sir. When do you want to come back to visit? - Ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha!
