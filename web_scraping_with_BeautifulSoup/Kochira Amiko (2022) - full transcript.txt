No. I also want to practice calligraphy. You can't practice calligraphy if you haven't finished your homework. Then I'll just watch. No. Do your homework well and study hard every day. Listen to the teacher carefully, can you do that? Don't sing or scribble on the desk during class. Can you do that? Don't play boxing anymore. Stop playing the games of farming and Indians.

Sure, you can. Right, turn this around. Right, lift this up, and the flash will turn on. That's it, you're good to go. I'll take the picture. Wait a moment, Amiko. I can't believe it. Didn't I just say to wait a moment? Hmm? Just now was just practice. The real one is coming up. We'll take a proper photo. Forget it. You don't have to take a picture of me, Amiko, really. We're going to take a picture, everyone, look this way. We're going to take a picture.. Okay, thank you, Amiko Today is your birthday. I made your favorite mixed fried rice. I'll definitely have two bowls. Didn't you say you wanted two bowls? No, I don't want anymore. I can't eat anymore. I want to eat this. Mmm, it's delicious. Delicious, delicious. It's so delicious that I want to lick the bowl. What's wrong? Why are you staring at Mom's mole all the time? Will it fall off? I don't know. Anyway, you shouldn't keep staring. Let me see the bald spot. I want to see. Hey, Nori-kun, it's very pretty. The yellow one is very pretty. It can speak and say a lot even if it's far away Impressive, right? You should try it too. And the camera, you can take a picture of Mom, and then flash. Let's play with walkie-talkies. Oh, a earthworm! Hey, Nori-kun, there's an earthworm. Nori-kun! Nori-kun, welcome back. -I'm back. -Welcome back. This is for you to eat. What is this? Finally, you're talking. I'm asking you what this is. It's a birthday present the adults gave me yesterday. Is it a birthday gift? Yes, it's for you. Eat it. No, if I take it back, Mom will scold me. Then eat it now. Now? Isn't it chocolate? You eat it. It's not chocolate, is it a biscuit? Is it delicious? It's okay, a bit stale. Then eat it anyway. We can't call an ambulance. Let's go directly to the hospital. Come on, I moved, I moved. Kota, help me. Over here... Slower, slower, slower. Slower, slower. -Not like this, not like this. -Slower Slower. Don't block the way. Slower. Okay, okay, okay. The baby should have been born by now. I don't know. When was it born? I don't know. I want to practice. Okay. Good. Please respond, please respond. Hello, hello. Hello, hello. Welcome back. Has the baby been born? Where is Dad? Welcome back. Has the little baby been born? Where is Dad? He went to the hospital. What about the little baby? The baby is no longer here. Then where is the baby? The baby is nowhere to be found. Welcome back. I'm back. I'm back. Were you waiting for us? All covered in sweat. Please come in. I brought some snacks and juice. Thank you, Amiko. Look, look! I prepared a little magic trick for Mom. Watch closely. Wow, amazing! Impressive, right? Just a little bit more, and I could have become a big sister. What a pity. Cheer up! Yeah, I'm really disappointed. We're leaving. Kota, you need to cheer up too. Okay, got it. We'll go first. Found it! Two leaves. Huh? I found a mushroom. A mushroom? - Amazing. - It's so small. Oh dear. Oh dear. Is this a mushroom? No, it's a bean. Then you can have this. This is for you as a gift. Amiko. Thank you. Huh? Thank you for what? You're really gentle, and Kota is too. Dad is also gentle. Everyone is. Is that so? Am I gentle? Everyone is gentle, so Mom is very happy. Am I gentle? These chopsticks were given to me by Kota. He said I can use these chopsticks to eat yummy food. That way, I can quickly regain my spirits. Using the chopsticks Kota gave me to eat the bento we made together with Amiko. Mom is truly happy. What's wrong? A grasshopper. Soon, you can start learning calligraphy. Okay. Can I go and see? Huh? I meant you should practice calligraphy too. Huh? Even if I'm your mom, I won't go easy on you. Be prepared, okay? Today, I'm going to start learning calligraphy. That person over there. That's Amiko. Hey, Tanaka. Don't be so rude. We're having a meeting right now. Wow, it's a flying kiss. - Alright, everyone, stop making noise. - Did you see that? Another flying kiss. How lovely. Is it for Nori-kun, Who is Nori-kun? Amiko's crush is Nori-kun you know. Amiko wants to marry Nori-kun. Kissing, kissing, kissing, kissing. -Kissing, kissing. -You guys are so gross. I'm not going to the calligraphy class today. I'm speaking. Hey. Hmm, I know. I just came to say that I'm starting to go to the calligraphy classroom today. Is it not possible? Well, we can talk after I finish class. Today, I want you to write something for me. Why do you want me to write? It's inexplicable. Then let me tell you why. No need. Let me tell you. No need. It hurts. I'm just entrusted by your mother to take care of you. She said kota's younger sister is a strange kid. Don't let her be bullied. If she does anything strange, you should remind her. So, I'm going home with you after school. You're so annoying. What's so funny? Why are you messing around? The teacher's little baby is not doing well, and you're still laughing. The baby is not doing well, but it was born. It's funny. You're talking nonsense. Although it was born, it still died. That's not considered being born. Can you help me write? I already said today is not a day for practicing calligraphy. Write it on this. Isn't this the Yokata family's sign? What are you doing? Yokata family will get angry. Write "Little Brother's Grave" on it. Are you crazy? My younger brother died. I want to make a tombstone for him. Idiot, go away. Please, Xiao Fan, please. No. Please, please. This is the biggest request of my life. So annoying. This is for celebrating Mom's birthday. Celebrating? For Sayuri sensei? Hey, I have something to show you. What is it? Come outside for a moment. Outside? If we're going outside, we need to put out the fire. Okay, okay. Come here. What is it? - This way. - What is it? Hey, what is it? Hurry up. Come quickly, this way. Right, you didn't come to the Red House today. Where did you go? I had something to do. Come here. I thought you didn't want to practice calligraphy anymore. No, I'll start practicing tomorrow. Come Wait a moment, okay? Come, come. Look at this. Isn't it beautiful? Hey, isn't it beautiful? I made it myself. We need to bury the body. What happened? I don't know. She suddenly started crying. Why? What is this? This is a tombstone. What is this? I asked Xiao Fan to help me write it. Hey. What are you guys doing? She did this. She played such a prank It's my brother's grave. Here he is. Hello, good evening. Sorry to disturb you so late. It's okay. Good evening. This time, we caused you a lot of trouble. No, no, that's... We were also in the wrong. No, no, no... You should apologize to me too. Forget it, forget it... We were also in the wrong. It hurts. It's all your fault. You made me get scolded. Dad. Hmm? What flavor is this? Huh? It's a very strange smell. Kota must be smoking. Hu? Have you been smoking? Hey, have you been smoking? Mind your own business. You've been smoking, right? I'm going to tell Dad. It smells awful. Ouch! You're so annoying. Go die. Oh no, I've become a bad kid. Dad, hey, Dad! Please don't make a big scene, okay? Be careful not to cause a fire, okay? Is that it? Is that all, Dad? Dad? Give me money. Huh? Give me money. No. This is kota's. Go ask someone else. Ouch! Your voice sounds nice. Really? It's like hitting a wooden fish. Hold on. She seems to be Tanaka's sister. Huh? Sorry, we got it wrong. We didn't know. You two don't look alike at all. Don't tell Tanaka, okay? Have you met Tanaka? No? Huh? No? Never? Never? Never? -I have. -Really? Yeah, I used to practice calligraphy with Tanaka. - She's looking at you. -And... -Staring at you all the time. -Looking at you. Nori-kun. Did you watch it yesterday? Which one? That, oh right, fireworks, fireworks. They are very beautiful and come in various shapes. Which one did Nori-kun write? Huh? The one He wrote. Hey, here it is. Wow, amazing. What? What's so amazing? Just amazing. I don't know what you're talking about. It's very beautiful. Your handwriting is ugly, isn't it? By the way, this one is mine. Welcome back. I'm back. Amiko, let's have dinner. Hey, let's play Othello later. You go play with Kotaro. He's not here. Isn't he here today? He's never here. Really? Dad saw him last time. I haven't seen him either. I've never seen him. Is that so? It's strange. I heard a strange sound. Hello. Nobody was there, but I heard a strange sound. Hello, I heard a strange sound on the balcony. Is that so? Yesterday, there was something like a ghost on the television. Really? That's so scary. A man was possessed by a ghost. A man was possessed by a ghost. Terrifying, isn't it? Yes, swing your arms well, move forward, move forward Here we go, get ready. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Here we go, get ready. OK, that's a good start. Kick forward with force from your knees. Here we go, get ready. Huh? Did you hear it? Huh? Listen, can you hear it? That sound. So disgusting. Hey, wait, Tanaka. -Huh? -What's wrong with this guy? -Tanaka, don't run. -Keep going. How many times do I have to tell you, Tanaka? Hey -Keep going. Don't stop. -Stand still. -Keep going. -Don't stop. -Fall down, fall down. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. I'll sleep here tonight. Why? Didn't I tell you last time? There's a ghost on the balcony. It's just your imagination. You watch too much TV. It's not my imagination. Maybe it's my younger brother's ghost. Didn't he die before? Maybe he hasn't been able to move on. Dad? Hey. Hey. To be honest, you smell really bad. Don't you take baths? Why? Don't you have a bathtub at home? We do. That can take a bath. Don't disturb the people around. Think about it for a moment. By the way, let me tell you, it has the greatest impact on me. The wind is blowing towards me. You see, do you understand now? I happen to be in the spotlight. Hey, what's the matter with you? You never come to school, and when you do, you smell bad Do you know that your brother has dropped out of school? Do you know what that means? Brother? Idiot! Everyone has always been afraid of your brother, so they didn't dare to touch you. Since your brother is no longer here, it only takes a finger to knock you down. Do you understand? Ah. What "ah"? I mean you might get killed. Don't you want to be killed? Ah, I don't want to. Then at least take a bath. And why are you barefoot? Where are your indoor shoes? Also, why aren't you wearing socks? I don't have indoor shoes, and the socks are at home. Oh, you should try getting stepped on like this. It'll hurt and make you cry. Let me step on you. Hey! Just kidding. What if I step on a thumbtack? Okay, let's do an experiment to see. Right here, right now. I'm joking. Idiot. But it's not bad. It feels like a symbol of freedom. Although it's also a symbol of being bullied. There's a ghost on my balcony. What? There's clearly no one there, but there are strange sounds. What kind of sounds? I'm really tired, and it's noisy. So, what kind of sounds are they? That sound... Crack, crack, pop, swoosh, swoosh. It's so noisy, please stop, please stop. By the way, I just noticed, what does this Chinese character on your paper say? This character "私" doesn't need to be followed by "shi" (characters that sound similar). Adding that makes it incorrect. The character "朝" is also written with "车" on the left, it's really scary. Your handwriting is so ugly, it's a mystery. Your mom is clearly a calligraphy teacher. Ah, it's okay. You haven't studied calligraphy, right? If you learn a bit, you'll be able to write better. Well, I also have some responsibility for this. Now I can say it. Actually, my friends and I made a bet. To see who could notice you first. Whoever shouts "It's Amiko" first wins 100 yen. It's not limited to the calligraphy classroom, it can be anywhere in school. Really? Maybe I shouted too many times. Are you also a student in the calligraphy classroom? Don't you know me? Then, is my handwriting nice? And about what you said about the balcony, Is it the balcony where you dry persimmons or clothes at your house? Or the smaller one on the other side? What did you say? Ghost? Didn't you say there was a ghost? What ghost? I'll kill you. Didn't you just say it was on the balcony? Ah, right. There's no one there, but there are strange noises. Clap, click. I heard it. It's the ghost. Right? What should we do? How would I know? There's no such thing as monsters. Monsters are all lies. It's just people who overslept and got confused. But, but, I'm still a little scared. There's no such thing as monsters. Monsters are all lies. But what if a monster really appears? Then put it in the fridge and freeze it into an ice block. But, but, I'm still a little scared. There's no such thing as monsters. Monsters are all lies. But if it's a kid, let's make friends. After shaking hands, let's have some snacks. But, but, I'm still a little scared. There's no such thing as monsters. Monsters are all lies. In the land of monsters, it's filled with monsters. After hearing this story, go take a bath. But, but, I'm still a little scared. There's no such thing as monsters. Monsters are all lies. There's no such thing as monsters. Monsters are all lies. There's no such thing as monsters. Monsters are all lies. There's no such thing as monsters. Monsters are all lies. Can you sing softly? Mom is already asleep. But, but, I'm still a little scared. There's no such thing as monsters. Monsters are all lies. Amiko. What do you like to eat? Meat. And what about Amiko? Huh? What do you like to eat? Meat. Kota likes to eat meat, and Amiko also likes to eat meat. Mom cooks everything deliciously. Looking forward to it, right? Looking forward? Sorry for talking in this kind of place. It's okay, it's okay. Um, how is your wife's health? Um, well... Sometimes she's clear-headed, sometimes confused. Teacher, listen to me. Mom sleeps all day and has no energy at all. If she stays in the hospital for a while, she gets better, but once she comes back... It's still a mental issue. Affected by the environment, there's also a possibility of deterioration. Hey, wait. Who is in the hospital? It's not Mom, right? Really? That's really not easy. So, Tanaka, see you at school tomorrow. Thank you. Hey, I said, who is in the hospital? Mom. Now? Is she in the hospital now? She's at home now. I see, she's at home now. Ah, you scared me. Hey, why don't you try asking Mom to get up and cook? Amiko. Hmm? Let's move. Huh? I know, you two got a divorce, right? Huh? This means divorce. We don't need this. We need this. This can still be used, right? We don't need this. Don't waste it. We only took one photo. No. Don't waste it. We only took one photo. Look, there are still 23 shots left. Didn't I say we don't need it? We need this. That's it, there's one more missing. Look for the other one. No, there isn't. There must be two. Yeah, there were two. It's gone. Ah, it's hidden. Dad, you hid it, didn't you? I was thinking of playing a spy game with my little brother. He's not your little brother. He is. He's definitely my little brother. When he died, he couldn't move on, and it's still the same now. Dad, let me tell you. In this room, you can hear the voice of a ghost. Come over here, please. I'm not lying to you. Really, really. Please, you can definitely hear it. Please, be quiet. It's a girl, a little girl. What? A girl? A girl's ghost? It's not a ghost. Amiko. Now, Dad. Sorry, I wasn't talking about ghosts. It's a person. It's a baby girl. Baby? You don't understand, do you? That's what I'm saying. Amiko doesn't understand, right? So noisy. Tanaka, go sing. Amiko, you're here again. Oh. You sing so badly, I'm tired of listening to it. Teacher, lend me the microphone. Is this your private karaoke room? There are no monsters. Monsters are all lies. It's just people who overslept and got it wrong. But still, I'm a little scared. There are no monsters. Monsters are all lies. My eardrums are about to burst. What should we do if a monster really appears? Wait a moment. What's wrong? Come in. Since morning, I haven't been feeling well. I wanted to rest in the infirmary for a while, but I changed my mind. -I'm going back to the classroom. -Nori-kun. Your complexion looks bad. Take a short rest. Amiko, can you keep quiet? Yes. Nori-kun, do you want some juice? You look tired. Is it because you study too hard and don't get enough sleep? Please drink this. Do you have anything sweet? Something sweet? Ah. Here. Even if you don't have much appetite, eat it if you get hungry. Amiko, don't eat alone, okay? I know that. I've had this before. -Does the teacher like it too? -Yes, it's delicious. Do you want to go back and rest early, or lie down on the bed for a while? I want to go back early. Okay I'll call your parents. Eat this. Ah, there's a thread. Nori-kun. Nori-kun, wake up. Good morning. Are you okay? Left, down, up, can't see clearly. Ah, it's on the right. Ah, it's delicious. I've had this before. Nori-kun, wake up. This is what you like to eat, look at it. You used to eat it on the way home from school. It's the chocolate from my birthday. It's the one you finished eating. It's a cookie. That's what it is. -You like it. -I'll kill you. -You like it. -I'll kill you. -You like it. -I'll kill you. -You like it. -I'll kill you. You like it. Are you okay? It's a mole monster. This is where I'm bald. From Amiko's perspective, what am I? Am I a brother or a bald person? You're a brother. That's right. Then, from Amiko's perspective, what is Dad? Is he a dad or glasses? He's a dad. That's right. Then, the person we met just now, Was it Mom or a mole? That's right. That's correct. Ah, it's about the same size. I'll jump. Here, eat it. It's very sweet. It's so sour, so sour. What are you doing? Jumping. Is your sense of taste normal? I broke my nose bone. I think she hit something protruding when she fell. Let me ask her personally later. It hurts so much. I want to be hospitalized. Dad, I want to be hospitalized. Don't talk. Hey, Mom has been hospitalized before, right? Amiko wants to be hospitalized too. Can she? Don't talk. Cunning, only Mom can stay in the hospital. Please answer, please answer. This is Amiko. Hello, please answer. Hello. Hello, it's me, Amiko. Mom and Dad got divorced. I'm going to move with Dad. So, maybe we won't be at home anymore. I have to say goodbye to all the neighbors and to Nori-kun. Nori-kun cried last time. He told me not to say it to anyone, but I didn't say anything. Also, that's not a younger brother, it's a younger sister. Why didn't anyone tell me? Everyone is secretive, it's been like that every day. There are ghosts. Please answer, please answer. This is Amiko. This is Amiko. Please answer, please answer. So scary, so scary. Brother, save me, I'm scared, Brother. Hey. Alright. Ah, so tired. What is it? Oh, it's you. I thought it was a ghost. What are you doing? Which one did Nori-kun write? Huh? Ask him again? You always ask, "Which one did Nori-kun write?" You're so focused. How do you pronounce this? Golden phoenix flower. Huh? Such a strange pronunciation. Is it a surname? Hey, are you talking about Washio? Is "How do you pronounce this?" referring to Washio? Who is Washio? It's Nori-kun, the one you like the most. What about Golden phoenix flower? Idiot, Golden phoenix flower refers to the characters written here, it's the name of a flower. How do you pronounce it? Washio Yoshinori. Washio Yoshinori. By the way, this is my name. Can you read it? You can read it, right? Hey. Washio Yoshinori, Washio Yoshinori. Washio Yoshinori, Washio Yoshinori, Washio Yoshinori. Are you moving? Where are you moving to? Grandma's house. Is it far? Really? But we've really been together for a long time, And now we're finally going to part ways. You're the one, right? The person who knows Amiko very well. What? Don't you also know me well? I don't know. I'll kill you, you know. Forget it, anyway, you only have Kotori in your eyes. No matter how annoying I am, You never blame me. It's been like this since we were kids. You're really amazing. I admire you. Am I disgusting? Rather than saying "disgusting," would it be more accurate to say "clingy"? Where am I disgusting? The place where you're disgusting? There are about 10 billion of them. Hmm, where? About 10 billion. Should I start from the beginning and tell you? Or should I write them down and make a list for you? Start from the beginning and tell me. Where exactly am I disgusting? If we're talking about where... well... Hmm, I hope you tell me. Well... This is a secret that only I know. Don't forget about me when you move, okay? - Dad - Hmm? Can I stay in this room? Go ask Grandma. Grandma, can I stay in that room? Yes, you can. What about Dad's room? - This tastes good. - Is it delicious? This is called green beans. This is also delicious. Hmm, watercress is also very tasty. Bitter gourd. Great, we have it. - Great. - Huh, nobody has it. Great. Okay. - That's the King. - Got it. One more round, one more round. One more round, let's have one more round. Grandma doesn't want to play anymore. Then, Dad, it's your turn. Dad, shuffle the cards. Okay, done. Dad, shuffle the cards. Dad? Shuffle the cards.
