[ROMEO AND RADHIKA] VOICE OVER: This is Late Rohitdas Mirchand Yogi College of Engineering. His heirs started this college ten years ago, so... ...that the coming generation can study engineering. Then carved his statue and placed it in the middle of the college. Either so that everyone gets inspired by seeing the statue... ...or so that people will know how good his grandfather was. It was upto the individuals to decide. Every year around 400 to 500 students graduate from the college. But how many of them become an Engineer? Even the owner does not have an answer. And who cares about such things in todays self financed education. The parents of the students pay the fees to the owner... ...the students are interested to take a selfie with the statue. And the statue feels as if he is a celebrity. [HUMMING] Hello Boss. Hi. [GRUNTS] [CAMERA SHUTTER] Hi Juhi. Juhi, do you believe in love at first sight? No. Even I don't believe. How can someone fall in... ...love by seeing someone for the first time. But ever since I have seen you... Since then I have been very... Juhi, Juhi. Hi Pinky. I don't believe in love at first sight. How can someone fall in love by seeing someone for the first time. But since the time I have seen you... Oh! Moni. Hi Moni. Moni, actually I hate love at first sight. How can someone fall in love by seeing someone for the first time. But ever since I have been seen you... Moni. Hi. VOICE OVER: The owner is use to all these strange anecdotes. The college has made a big rack to... ...keep the awards that the college gets. These trophies have been bought from the market by the Principal. The owner sees a dream everyday. Atleast one of these students become a real Engineer. And him and the college proud. Good morning. Nice video. Good, very good. - Sorry ma'am. - Why sorry? Even I use to stand in the parking lot, to see my favourite professor. But that time technology was not that advanced. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] You, don't smoke? I cannot believe. Don't you make a video of the girls in your class? [CROW CHIRPING] Or you don't like any girls in your class? They do not wear a saree. Why? What so special in sarees? I don't know but I like it. Naughty boy. VOICE OVER: The owner had also done love marriage. With her college friend Ramila Ghori. He had a dream that one of his student... ...atleast make a small toy, if not a robot. Whose patent can be sold in the entire China. But everyone here is a Romeo and not an Engineer. And that is because the word Romeo is contained in his name. That is available free of charge in this college. "Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, Rahdika." "Radhika." - Hi Rahul. - Hi Radhika. What's happening? Practical. It is working on a solar panel. When did you make it? It was not there until yesterday. Surprise. Secret pattern. Come, giving you a lift. Let's go. Let me see your secret pattern. - Did you seat? - Yes. - Should we start? - Yes. What happened? I think there is some problem in the solar panel. What happened to your secret pattern? It's ok Rahul. It will be fixed in two minutes. Do one thing. Keep this pattern of yours, a secret. Let it be Rahul. You finish your work and we will meet in some time. It will be done. Please stay. VOICE OVER: There is one thing that the owner feels bad. That there... ...has not been a single good Engineer from the college. But he is proud that there are friends... ...like Sholay and Three Idiots. - Come on fast. - Rahul. We have cut it. You are defeated. - Come Rahul. - C'mon Sunny. Sunny c'mon. C'mon Sunny. You are defeated again. It is not just difficult to defeat Rahul, but is impossible. I don't agree. Rahul. Hi guys. Put your tongue inside and close your zip. Hey c'mon Radhika, why did you come here? Do we ever follow you to the washroom? -Jeet. You scoundrel.

If you propose her, you will get to eat such hot thepla daily. I tried multiple times to propose her. But I don't know why I get so nervous. Are you idiot or what? This is our last year in college. If you don't propose her now, then forget about her. - But why? - Forget. Just last 21 days to go. If you don't propose her now, then go to her for Rakshabandhan every year. And her little children will call you uncle. - Don't say that. - What else should I say? - I will send her to you. Just propose her. - Here? On the road?

No. I will not do that. Radhika. Don't you feel that the boys of our college... ...read your notes more than Dr. Reddy's notes. Everyone has their notes. They just want a way to talk to me. - Exactly. - Romeos. Why were you hiding the rose that day? Go and meet Radhika and propose her. I am afraid that she will break our friendship. We have five more girls in our group. Friendship belt or rakhi. You can make them tie, whatever you want. But think about marrying Radhika. And if you don't propose her, then I will propose her. Do you think she will say no to you? I am habituated to hear a denial. And also of getting a beating. Whatever. I talk to the girl directly. I don't get nervous like you do. - If he gets nervous, what about you? - What about me? You stop this cheap behaviour. You f**** I am trying to encourage you to set you... ...love story and you are hitting back on me? Go and propose Radhika.

Professor Nandan, you are so much interested in music. Then why did you study engineering? Only for my father. To be honest, I really loved music. So much so that... ...I got a harmonium from one of my friend. But look at this. My father hit me with a cane. Professor, are you feeling relaxed? You care so much for me. I do like that. Can I ask you something Komalben? I mean..Komal ji. After a decade, someone called me handsome. Oh wow. Who? - You. - Me? No professor. First you messaged me that I looked pretty. Don't lie.

Then you can sing. But don't harm my prestige. - Sing nicely, ok. - Okay. Think of audience as well. Sir, love you. I love you. Hey Rahul look, we can see the moon in the afternoon. Those rascals have screwed me. "My heart is busy in loving you." "I thought she will love this in love, but instead she did something else." "There is a secret in my heart since centuries." "She did not say but the eyes conveyed it by mistake." "My admire, you are my desire." "I feel so high when you look at me." "My admire, you are my desire." "I feel so high when you look at me."

And your eyes are filled with tears because of Radhika. C'mon Rahul. - Yes Rector sir? - Exams are over. You don't have to go home? Yes sir. If you do not want to go home, then you can arrange another stay. Ok sir. Oh no. One more hurdle. I don't want to go to Rajkot. If I go to Rajkot, my father will send me to Bhatinda to drive trucks. So what is the problem? - I will be the truck leader. - You fool. I do not want to leave Ahemdabad. You should not leave Ahmedabad. - Else, how shall we find Radhika? - What? You and your Radhika.

Anything urgent? Is it ok if we talk later? You left without even meeting me. Now tell me, what did have think? Answer me. Rahul, first you settle down. I can settle only, if you agree. I am not talking about life. I am talking about the career, you idiot. Don't you see your career with me? As of now I can just see my responsibilities. And that is my village. Ok, bye. Radhika listen to me... Hello..Radhika... How much do you have? Speak up. Twenty eight hundred. From all our bank accounts. Only twenty eight hundred? Let us do one thing. Let us get some money from Mehta sir. Mehta sir will give us another twenty eight hundred or maybe... ...five thousand. How many days we will survive with that? - Go to hell, Mehta. - What? I am just saying that this is complicated. Don't take it seriously. Let us go. I am hungry. We only have so much money. And we have to survive for many days. Take it. -This is what we have. You will enjoy. [TRAFFIC AMBIENCE] Can I order bread? Uncle... Get us some bread and some onion. Hey we don't have money. Where you will get it from? Forget it then. Manage with this. Uncle, please switch on the AC. Yes, it will be installed by tomorrow. - There is no AC here? - Tell him to install... ...one. I am not comfortable without one. - He wants an AC here. - I can't survive without an AC. Can we get our bill? Get the bill uncle. Hello Guys. Don't take tension. I have settled your bill. Oh man! This crazy person has come again. Hey guys! Don't misunderstanding me. First listen to me. Then you will understand, what I am trying to say. And what help I want from you.

Who is there? There is a small branch of Tamilnadu's Gelvid bank. There are only 200 accounts in the branch. There is one 50 year old fixed deposit. Neither the owners nor the relatives not... ...the nominees come to claim the money. And I have seen this since the last 25 years. If someone from you can become a fake nominee, we can... ...claim the money and distribute it amongst ourselves. We do not want to do that. This is fraud. You may go now. We cannot even think about this kind of fraud. If my father came to know then... ...so he will hit all of us very hard. - Yes. - You are right Bhupi. Let's go. - Thank you. - Yeah, let's go. [CRICKET CHIRPING] - Let's go. - Let's go. FD is for five crore. What are you saying? But if we go to the bank, will they handover the money to us? There is a clerk from the bank... ...involved. in this social work or ours. Social work? So there is no technical issue. But this is a huge amount. - Yeah. - Oh brother. Some of the bank have bigger FD's than this. Nobody comes to claim that deposit. But what if there is an issue in the future and we get caught? Point. You are right. If an issue happens in future, we will tell the owners that the nominees took the money. There will be a real picture of yours. All other details will be fake. If the date and address will be wrong, how will the police catch you? If police will have to catch me first, before coming to you. They will put me behind the bar and my job will be gone. That is why I am telling you that it is hundred percent risk free. All of us will get 1 crore rupees as a part of our share. "There are dreams in the eyes knowingly or unknowingly."

What? Where does Radhika stay? Who are you? -We are her friends. We have come from Ahmedabad. He is also her friend. - Hello. - The one sitting behind... ...he is her best friend. What happened? Why are you looking at me this way? These friends of yours have come from Ahemdabad to meet you. Now I will give you a divorce. Why are you talking like an illiterate? So your friends have come to meet you... ...so I become an illiterate in front of them? Go away with them. What are you doing? How can you her this way? Why should I take her? She is your Radhika. She is not my Radhika. She is your wife. Listen uncle, I think there is some misunderstanding. Don't call me uncle. I already dared you. We have been married just month ago. You don't interfere in between gunny bag. You skeleton. I will teach you a lesson. Raju. One minute. What happened? Uncle. These people came from the city to meet my Radhika. No. Uncle we are not here to meet this Radhika. We want to meet the one from Romeo college. - Romeo college? - I mean... Uncle, we are looking for the Radhika that... ...studied in Rohitdas Mirchand Yogi college. We are her friends. We have come to meet her. I know that Radhika. She has grown up while playing in my lap. Myself Imtiyaz. - Rahul. - She is my niece. ...and Radhika's father Mohan bhai... ...he is my best friend. - Good. - Okay. - I will take you to her house. - Come uncle sit in the car. - Sorry sorry. - Sorry brother. Let's go. Come on. - Come uncle. - Radhika. Gauribhabhi, Mohan where are you all? What happened Imtiaz? What is it? Radhika's friends have come from the city. Oh ok. Welcome. Greetings son. - Hail Lord Krishna. God bless you. - Rahul. Bhupinder. Take their blessings. - Give me your blessings. - What? - God bless you. - This is Sunny. - All are very cultured. - Is it? Good that you guys have come. Let me call Radhika. - Radhika. - Your girlfriend will be here now. Let me get some water. Your friends are here. Come here. - Hi Bhupi. - Hi. Hi Sunny. - Hi. - How did you like our surprise? We had told you that we will come to your village after the exams. So we are here. Don't do overacting. Even though it is a village, noone is dumb here. - Ok sweet heart. - Rahul. Yes? Are you here to meet Radhika or to see the village? To serve. Serve? Whom do you want to serve? To serve? We had created one device during our engineering study. Two wheeler with a solar panel. Fortunately our device was bought a big... ...company and we got a lot of money. So we have decided, let's spend some money... ...for a social cause. - Good. - Good. What a great thought you have. You are a nice child. Thank you Mummy. - I will give it. - Let me do it. He is a cultured person. - I will do some preparations for lunch. - Ok. Laugh as much as you want. Because you do not know, where you have come. Mr. Vakhariya. There is only an entry to our village. Only entry no exit. I have purchased the land outside your village to build a farm house... And that too at very high price. Why would I sell it to you? Vakhariya sir. Everyone had come empty handed... ...and will go empty handed. You are not going to take this land and mansion, when you die. It will be a service if you sell your land someone needy. But you are paying very low rates for that land. How can I give land worth 3 crores, in 25 lakhs only? - Just think about it. - Vakhariya. Hail Lord Krishna. - Hail Lord Krishna. - Sir. I had a quarrel in the village. And Mohan Das is getting all the credit. Then why did you come here? That boss will be very happy? He will give you compliments? Why? Deva. We rule the village. But not like king. Like a servant. We will hunt. But not like Lion. Like a mouse instead. Eat a little bit. And then puff a little. No one will know anything. That we have bitten it. No one will know. How often has this been explained to you? But you duffers don't understand it at all. Whenever you feel, you just put my honor at take. You just do that bastards. Vakhariya sir. Do you play baseball? Baseball? Either you hit me with this base so hard... ...that I forget about buying the land. Else you sell that land to me. Sell the land to me Vakharia sir. Please, request. Say something Vakhariya sir. Should I give you the base or the pen? No Vakhariya Sir. The pen is mine. It is Parker pen. My luckiest pen. Take it... ...and sign here. One minute. Here too. That's it. Vakhariya sir have some sweets. Open your mouth. - Did you like it? - Yeah. Bhupi? Did you like it? Awesome. Yeah. I am getting a hot bread. Yes give it to us. Take this. No no no. -Take half. You will be able to finish it.. Eat it. You take this one. Give me some jaggery. - Did you like jaggery. - Yes I like it very much. Give me butter. - You want some butter? - Yes. He might not have eaten the butter from village? Very nice. That's it. Eat properly. I will take care. What should I serve you? You will have to take half a bread. - I am full. - I will not hear any excuse. It is just half a bread. You will be able to eat it. - What about you Bhupi? - Give him everything. Give me some more butter and jaggery. Very nice Bhupi. You speak very nice Gujarati. Uncle I am a Gujarati Sardar -Oh, is it? I was born in Rajkot. I stayed at Ahmedabad. My parents are from Amritsar. That is enough Bhupi. - Bhupi we all understood. - Have you food. Come on SRK. - DDLJ plan? - No. DRLJ. "Dilwale Radhika Le Jaayenge." Is it? Do you think it is that easy? Some one who loses courage loses everyone. Is this a Whatsapp message or was it written behind a bus? It was in a toilet. Just understand the feeling. Do you think that I will agree if you stay with... ...us for a couple of days and impress my parents. If you do not agree, I will marry a very hot model from the city. And I will take the marriage procession from your house. Because now I am a millionaire. Is it? How did you become a millionaire? Do you know that formulae of mine? - For the solar scooter. - Yes. The Chinese bought it. That was a very common formulae. And the parts that you had used were made in China. Actually the Chinese were not willing to take any... ...risk. Hence they bought the formulae from me. Rahul, you are lying. No. I swear by you. Swear? You desi. What are you doing? What is someone sees us? Coward. "God, please shower your blessings on me." "So that my love always stays in my heart." "God, please shower your blessings on me." "So that my love always stays in my heart." "Even if I die or the entire world is upset on me."

"You are an ocean of love and I am a wave." "God knows whether I am capable for you." "You look deadly when you come with makeup." "You like an angel to me."

"Even if I die or the entire world is upset on me." "Even if I die or the entire world is upset on me." "I will not stay without you even for a moment." [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hey Romeo. [BIRDS CHIRPING] You have come forcibly at my home. Now you have started dreaming here? So this is my reality. The village, the farm, the hard work. You would be dreaming for a Deepika Padukone or Alia Bhatt. Your dreams would have been shattered. I don't care about that. And I will get married to you. Please put a board on your forehead that I will not improve. Thanks for the compliment. What should I do with you? Just approve my proposal. Radhika, I love you so much. Why do you keep saying the same thing. What will you gain by loving me and getting married with me. Why don't you understand? We are friends. And let us continue to be friends. But... I can see that love for me in your eyes. I do not disagree. But I have to constraint that love to my eyes. What about the feeling that I have? And what about my feelings? Look... one minute. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello. Yes. Oh..ok. That's fine. We will talk about it later. What happened? We were talking with a donor for the donation of the hospital. The response does not seem to be positive. Don't worry about money. I am there. Seriously? Take me seriously atleast sometime. I have millions of rupees from the project. Now I am a millionaire. Our time has changed. Its fine. I will freshen up and then we will go to school. Ok. Big brother. - How are you? - I am fine. You were going to come out after a couple of days. I am the younger brother of JD. If I cannot do some setting for a few days, my life is not worth it. You are right. Come on. Come on take the car. You will not improve. The grant for the school has been approved since 2 years. But the mayor does not have time to get the grant. Idiot. Aren't the school teachers complaining? Teachers? There is only one teacher for the entire school... Ayesha. - Hi Radhika. - Hi Ayesha. - Meet my friends, Rahul, Bhupi, Sunny. - Hi. Hello guys. - Hello ma'am. - Sit down. - This is my village. - Hello. So Radhika, any good news for this building? - Yes.

When he sees a woman, he gets sentimental. Don't hit me builder. We need to go and check the dispensary. - Let's go. - Yes, let's go. He is Doctor Rathod. - Hi. - Hello. He is the only doctor in our village. He could have started his own practise in the city. But he is a different kind of person. Only if the old dispensary gets renovated... ...then the village will benefit a lot. We will lose more than half our money in the bargain. I think the friendship is getting expensive. Yes. I have discussed this in the court. They will help as much as possible. If you can contribute 3 million rupees... ..then many people will be benefitted in the village. They will be able to undergo operations and surgery here. And what about us if we give them 3 million. Who will solve that problem? SRK, we are planning on your words. Hope you will not say no later on. I can sacrifice my life for you senorita. Your life will not be able to build the hospital. We will need 3 million rupees. Will you give it? [TYRE SCREECH] [CAR DOOR OPEN] Hail Lord Krishna Mohandas sir. Imitiaz Ali? Greetings. Hello doctor Rathod. I am Jamnadas. I am the mayor of this village. You are planning to make a hospital? Without consulting the mayor? Good. Social cause. There is a need to have a hospital in the village. Hence we are planning. What are you doing in the village? If you get a fracture.. ..it will not be repaired. [BIRD CHIRPING] Below the lovely blue skies. The love on the earth cherishes. Below the lovely blue skies. I got some more. I will complete and then leave. What are you doing here? - We are trying to entangle. - It is our old habit. Do you want to join us? What are you doing here? - I am relieving myself. - What does it mean? It means we are urinating. What does that mean? We actually had a chilled cold drink some time ago. And then it fought with the kidney, that I want to come out. Aren't you screwed as well? Your face tells me that you are screwed up. That is not correct. We are the guest of Mohandas uncle. Rahul, Sunny and Bhupi. - Hi. - Hi. Bye. - Come on. - Bye. Bye. Ok Bye. I just asked them what are you doing? They gave me a big lecture on urine. I have seen him somewhere. Where would have I seen him? [PAPER RUSTLE] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello Mehta sir. Did Radhika agree for the marriage? I am still talking to her. Mehta sir, we are thinking of renovating the dispensary. First you work on yourself. Then you worry about yourself. I am working on the dispensary. Talk about your marriage with Radhika to Mohandas. Everything is being planned Mehta sir. Do it fast. Mehta sir, please explain him. I want Radhika as your wife. Did you hear that? Yes. It will be done. Have some patience. Mehta sir, I will talk to you later. Bye. Bye. Who is Mehta sir? He would be his accountant. No Dad. He is his father. Sorry. You call your father by the first name. Yes mom. Mohan uncle. Velji has been released from the prison. What happened? Who is this Velji? He is the younger brother of the mayor of the village. And he is the killer of my son. Jamnadas this is my 25th complaint. Where is the grant that our village gets from the district? There is no school in the village. There are no dispensaries. Forget the roads and the electricity... ...people have to wait for six days for the drinking water tanker. And that tanker comes to your house first... ...and if there is water left in it.. ..then it goes to the other people in the village. Your ancestors were the mayors of the village. Then why such a mess? We need an answer Jamnadas. Go and check in the next village. They have so many facilities. These are the basic need of the village. There is internet in the village. Then why is our village so backward? One minute. Aren't you taking the grant and keeping it to yourself? Give us an answer Jamnadas. How can you capture the village land? Give us an answer Jamnadas. Give the answer to Amar's questions. You are the mayor of the village. Answer the questions. Come on Amar. Please. One minute. Just listen to one thing. Let the people of the village be quiet. But I will not be quiet. I will not let you capture the village land. No Amar. This person is becoming a nuisance. He has captured everything. Leave me. - Let him go. - Hit him. Amar is forcibly trying to capture my land. I have explained him so much. This land does not belong to the village. It is mine. It belongs to JD. But he is not ready to listen. Amar. Now I will have to protect myself. Shouldn't I? Such people do not let me to live peacefully. - Amar. - Amar. They force me to use violence. But, I will not give my land to anyone. I will not give it to anyone. - No. - Amar. Amar. He has killed him. You have killed my only son. Cake. Today is the death anniversary of my only son. [CRICKET CHIRPING] Happy Birthday Amar. Don't know what do you think about me. But I am in front of you as is. I learnt about social cause and sacrifice only after I came here. How can someone sacrifice his life to protest... ...against the corruption in the village. Unbelievable. You are great Amar. You are great. You have got me in depression. [SIGHS] Now I promise Amar, that I will fight for you. Even though I am not a Macho man like you. I will never have the will power like you. But I will still fight for you. And this is my birthday gift to you. And ask your crazy sister to eat the cake. This is half a million. It is for my service to the village. Velji, should I hide it in the house? Or should we make an FD in the bank? This is strange Velji. The person who duped us of 50 million is in our village. And you are looking for him in the city. This is strange. Our forefathers would be swearing us today. You have looted the village for so many years. And we were looted by 3 novice. We should die of shame. Dad, it is time for the TV series. Its ok my child. Can someone please take her inside. What shall we do now? What shall we do? We will need to control our anger. Control. Stay away from violence. Simple. With the help of our friends who have come from the city... [CROW CHIRPING] ...and from the village funds, we are starting... ...to renovate our dispensary from today. [CAR DOOR OPENS] Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Hail Lord Krishna! Hail Lord Krishna! The renovation of the dispensary. And the mayor is not invited? Anyways, no ego. No ego. This is a social cause. I congratulate everyone. Now we will not have to go to the city for smaller diseases. But my dear Mohandas sir... ...I want to know where did you get this big fund from? These 3 boys who have come from the city. They are my daughter Radhika's friends. They gave 30 lakh rupees. And we have contributed for the remaining funds. And there is one more donor who has given 10 lakh rupees. Very good strategy. I will give 5 lakh from the village funds. You have the right to make use of the funds. Atleast provide some applause. Our country needs more youngsters like you. Dedicated youngsters like you. Youngsters who think of philanthropy. And you are magician. You became millionaire just after appearing for your engineering exams. Unbelievable friends. A Chinese company has bought our formula... ...that we developed during our study. Hence you received 50 million rupees. But as per my knowledge you are the worst... ...students of the Romeo college of Engineering. Duffers. No sir, we are weak in theories... But we are very good at practical's. Liars. You are lying. Mohandas sir, you are using the money from... ...the cheaters for the welfare of the village. Enough mayor. They are my friends and not cheaters. They are your friends. But they have cheated me of my money and... ...are trying to be a hero in the village. Your money? What rubbish. You can check with them my child. Rahul, is it true? Is it true Rahul? This is like a pick pocketer looting the money from a gentleman. And then he donated some money in the temple. And became a hero. Velji.. The fraud that you have done by becoming... ...the fake nominee in KLPD bank was my FD. Look at me. It looted my 50 million rupees by becoming a fake nominee in the bank. Go away... Go away. Hit them. - Hit them. - No. Give me my money back. The money does not belong to you. Stop Velji. Fighting with people does not suit our prestige. Forgive them. Did you see people? I do so much to take care of the village. He is working day and night. But no one applauds the hard work. And you were trying to do good with the money from these cheaters. I work hard for the development of the village. And you feel that I just loot you. Loot you. And these cheaters... ...do and fraud and it is called philanthropy? Very good Radhika. You and your friends. We should applaud you all. Let us hit them. - No. - Don't. Did it hurt you a lot? [VEHICLES HONKING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] One minute. It is Radhika. [VEHICLES HONKING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Radhika. I did not expect this from you. You have hurt my feelings. You have done such a big fraud. And you are lying on top of it. Radhika, I am sorry. What is the use of apologizing? We were disgraced in front of the entire village. I have just called to tell you that neither... ...me nor the village needs your help. This is our fight and we will fight it. And if you want to help, please go away from here. Radhika please. What did she say? She asked us to leave the village. What? How can we go now? Let us go and talk to her. How can we stay on the road in this condition? You are right. Why are you putting your weight on my shoulder? That Velji has hit us in front of the entire village. I hope there is no new trouble. All because of you. Stop talking nonsense. We are all equal partners to the crime. We are not in love with Radhika, like you. - Yes. - What can I do friends? I do not like without Radhika. Don't become too sentimental. We are friends. We are with you, whatever may happen. - Be careful before you commit. - Thank you my friends. - What are you doing? - Sorry. It is hurting a lot. Let us sit there. Come on. I had let you go because my money is with you. One week. You have seven days. Give me my 50 million rupees back. Else I will shoot you on the eighth day. And if you try to be smart again... ...I will publish the fraud that you have done in papers. Your parents will also not let you in the house. But the remaining 20 million are with... - ...the clerk and the manager. - What? We have already spent 5 million from the remaining 30 millions. 25 million rupees are remaining and we are ready to give it back to you. I want my 50 million rupees. Some money was used in the development of the village. And it is good for you village. 50 million. - Full. - 50 million. Did you understand? - 50 million. - Seven days and 50 million rupees. Seven days. - Seven. - Only seven? It will be done. Come on. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Who is calling now? [CELL PHONE RINGING] Mehta sir. Yes Mehta sir. Mehta sir. We are in a bit of a problem. This is not a small problem. [TRAFFIC AMBIENCE] Hello Chandu. Where were you? Why are you not picking my phone? You scoundrel. You said that this is a risk free scheme. Now we are screwed. We need to return 50 million to Velji in seven days. Yes. - Who are you? - You... One minute. Do not use violence. I will explain everything. Who is Velji's nominees? - It is you Rahul. - Yes. Who signature is in the banks books? Yours. And all this is already captured in the CCTV camera in the bank. And the money has been transferred to your account. So who will return the money to Velji? You cheater. Don't call me cheater. My name is Chandrashekhar. You are a cheater. Who had come to the bank as fake nominees. - I was just doing my duty. - So you will not... ...return your share of 20 million rupees? If I have not taken the money, why should I return it? You swine Chandu. I will kill you if you do not give us your share of 20 million rupees. Don't talk about violence Sardarji. If you use violence, my bank manager will... ...handover the entire CCTV footage to the police. You rascal. Police will arrest you on charges of... ...fraud and also hitting a bank employee. Why did you do this to us? This is a part and parcel in the life. Will you have some ice cream? Nope. Ok then, we will meet again. Sorry we will not meet again. Bye see you. Look at him. He is laughing in such a situation. You fool. [TRAFFIC AMBIENCE] Chandu has made a fool of us. He made us a fool. We are fools. The water has risen up to the nose. You are letting me know now. Me and your mother were waiting for you and Radhika in Baroda. And you have lost everything. Mehta sir we are screwed anyways. Why are you adding to it? You are our Godfather. - Please give us a way out from this mess. - Get aside. Mehta sir. Please get us 25 million from somewhere. 25 million. I have not seen more than 1 million rupees in cash my entire life. If all of us sell ourselves with our... ...house, we will not even get 10 million. And you are talking about 25 million. Velji is a dangerous man. He has hit all of us very hard. [CRICKET CHIRPING] There are 6 days left. Please do something. We don't have the capability to return the 5 million... ...that we have spent from the 30 million that had. I can give you half a million at the max. Let us do a police complaint. You are talking like a fool. We are criminals ourselves. Police will hit us with rods. Not anymore. Shall we sell our house? We will get 5 million rupees if we sell the house. Mehta sir. I don't understand why do you need to do... ...such a big scam to get a girlfriend. FD..wait a minute. Velji's FD has gone from the bank. Then instead of complaining in the bank... ...why is he asking money from you? Why is he blaming you? Doesn't this make sense? - Mehta sir. - Yes? - You go back to Baroda. - Why? We thought you're experienced and you will find a way out. - But you are not able to help. - Why not? If we see legally, Velji's FD has been withdrawn. So he can't ask for anything from the bank. Oh ***. Sorry. Mehta sir is right. See... Legally his FD is withdrawn. But Velji can prove that Rahul is not his son. And there is no one in his FD nominee named Rahul. And forget Rahul being his son, he isn't even married. Sunny, you've got a point. I was trying to explain the same thing. Idiots. Sorry Mehta sir. We love you. He hit us a lot. He hit us very hard. Oh Lord! He hit him so much. Here and there. - And here. - Not here. Here. Now shut up and sit quiet. Velji had come. Velji asked to give 5 million rupees else he will do a Police complaint. Oh God! We are in a trap from all the sides. Velji is trying everything to get the money back. He is asking us and also asking him. He is taking a revenge for the cheating we did with him. Oh Lord! Brother! Chandu, please ask her to keep quiet. Keep quiet. I won't keep quiet. - I will not keep quiet. - Please. Please keep quiet. Rahul. - Will you have an ice-cream? - Yes. Rahul let him go. Go. Sunny take it easy. Go. Did you apply oil? Why should I apply oil? - If you would apply oil then.. - If you... ...apply oil, you will not feel the pain. Come on. Apply oil. Oh Lord! He said apply oil and sleep. Everything will get fine. Shut up. You make me talk rubbish. [BIRDS CHIRPING] 2 Lakhs were deposited in 1970. In 1990 it became 32 Lakhs. It became 2 million in 2007. And it became 50 million in 2016. How did he get 2 lakh rupees in 1970, in such a small village? I did not have so much money in 2016. That is none of our business Mehta sir. His forefathers would have the money. He would have the land. What is this? This land belonged to our village 45 years ago. Jamnadas's father sold it off. For 2 lakh only. They sold the property of the village. That means the money from the FD belonged to the villagers. And it has become 50 million rupees. That money belongs to the villagers and not to Velji or JD. And Velji's forefathers knew that if he put so much... ...money in a nationalised bank, there would be enquiry. Hence he made an FD in a small bank like KLPD. - Yes. - That is correct. So we will be declared innocent, if we are able to prove Velji's scandal. And we will be able to say that the villager's money... ...has been spent on the village's development. But where shall we get all these details? We got the first step. We will be able to get to the top. We will have to act like a fool. - Dad. - Yes my child. I will fight the elections for the mayor. I don't want to be quiet due to someone's fear. And I will not change my life, due to their fear. But my child you can serve the village, even if you do not become a mayor. All this ideology become useless in front of power. You are right my child. But we do have just enough money to fight an election. We do not have the money to win an election. I know. We only have 3 things. Courage, effort and empty pocket. But we will fight. I like you courage. Eat. Oh no! I cannot walk in this. Greetings! - Imitiaz uncle. - Greetings. Thank you Imtiaz uncle. We are right and will prove that if you support. Surely. - Cover it properly. - Sorry. It gets entangled. - Come on. - Yes come on. Talati sir, these are the daughters of my uncles daughter. They stay out of India. They want to enquire about their fathers land. It is near the factory. Why do you want to enquire after so many years? The elder daughter is a writer. She wants to write a book on his father. Get the files from 1970. He has sold 100 acre land to RK builder in 1970. It is your right to get the facilities to your house. The election for the mayor is fast approaching. Hence be ready for your right and for a better living standard. Each and every vote is important. And that will decide your future. Very nice uncle. Take this money. You also take it. Very nice. Take it. You also take it. Please take. Hail Lord Krishna! Hail Lord Krishna! Uncle, people like you put in so much effort. But the people only care about the money. You will give big speeches for their votes. You will try to educate them. And in the evening, I will give them some money... ...and the entire population will vote for us. Why are you taking so much trouble? Velji, overconfidence can become a cause of destruction at times. That is the point that I am trying to make. Do not be overconfident, that you will win against us. Withdraw your nomination form. Where will you hide yourself, if you loose your deposit? You will also have a look for a similar place for you. Wow, so nice. Your girl has grown up. Look for a good groom and get her married. I will... ...help for any marriage expense that you would like. Do not just help me, but help all the villagers. I will leave the village with my family. Take it easy my child. Who am I to help them? God is the one who can help. I am just his messenger. Take it from him one and give it to the other. God, please make everyone prosperous. And start that from me. Hail Lord Krishna! Gopal sir, what happened to the land in Dholera? Who is refusing to sell it? His owner? Break his legs. They are creating problems. Why don't you take care of them? Do you want any escorts? There is someone from Germany. I also wanted to check if you want to come to Bangkok next month? Come with us. Just for a couple of days. Who gets their spouses to Bangkok? Everything will be ready there. Think about it and let me know in the evening. That's fine. Sir we wanted to make an enquiry. Hence wanted some help. There was a land deal in Jagana village about 45 years ago. - Veljibhai's father... - Get out from here. - What? - Get out. - Sir. - No one knows anything here. Get out. Sir, it is a matter of life and death. Please. Get out or I will break your legs. Let us leave. Come on. Don't push me. What is this? Ok. We are going. Bhupi, his is not fair. We cannot tolerate Mehta sir's insult. We cannot tolerate it. We cannot do anything. We are poor people. -We are not poor. - What should we do now? - Let us fight with them. Hail to the Lord. Get away. Hey. Keep quiet. I don't want any noise. You insulted Mehta sir? Now you are afraid? Give me the details that we need. How much did you pay to Velji's father in... ...1970, and how much did you sell it for? And how much did Velji's father get? We want the entire details. Take out your letter head. You need to sign on it. Fast. Sign it. Now write. And also write that JD and Velji are cheaters. And they have exploited the villagers. Write it and sign it. Fast. That is it. Come on. Respect the ladies. Give her some office work. And you start working like a peon. Let us go. Start playing. Hail Lord Krishna! Hail Lord Krishna! Hail Lord Krishna! Come on. Hail Lord Krishna! Long live JD sir. Long live JD sir. Long live LD sir. Long live LD sir. - Come in. Have a seat. - Hail Lord Krishna! Hail Lord Krishna! Velji. We have come for the application. Give us the form. - Give us the form. - Stop everyone. Sorry to disturb you sir. But... ...Jamnadas is not qualified to fight the election. Look at this. These are the list of scandals that he has done. And it also has the confessions of his builder accomplices. They are lying sir. Radhika is already worried about her... ...defeat even before filing her application. Hence she has called these people. And these people are cheaters themselves. They are cheaters. Hey Velji, make him understand. These people are fraud, who had become... ...fake nominee and took my money. And you believing these people? - Hey. - Please stop arguing. This is my office. Ok. Let me discuss with my collector. Sir please. Jamnadas, you will not be able to fill this form. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Thank you. Let's go. Thank you for everything. Love you. Get lost you silly. "The kite of heart is flying in the sky of love." "The thread of youth is very sharp." "Pull it with fun." "I fell in love with you gradually."

What happened? -It look like that Velji will kill somebody today. He will go to jail again. Please stop him. Velji. Doctor, how is my brother Velji? The bleeding has stopped, since we took stitches in time. He is out of danger now. But we will have to shift him to civil... ...hospital in the town for operation. Then call the ambulance. It is on it's way. Radhika has already called for it. Velji. Hey Velji. Hey Velji. My brother. Velji. Hey Velji. My brother, Velji. Jamnadas. Just think about this for a second. If this clinic would not have been there. Jamnadas, neither is God in Kaba nor in Kashi. It lives in the heart of the people. And heart has no language. It just talks to each other. Everybody likes position and power. But if everyone will become greedy, what will happen to this society. If there is tyranny everywhere, where will people like use go?
